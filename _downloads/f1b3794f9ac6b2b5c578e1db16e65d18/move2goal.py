class MoveToGoal(Node):
    """
    A ROS2 node that controls a robot to move toward a specified goal position.

    This class subscribes to odometry and IMU topics to track the robot's position
    and orientation. It also listens for control relinquishment messages to determine
    whether it should take control of movement. The node follows a state machine approach
    to:

    1. Rotate towards the goal.
    2. Move straight towards the goal.
    3. Rotate to the final desired orientation.
    4. Stop once the goal is reached.

    Velocity commands are published to the '/cmd_vel' topic to control the robot's movement.
