# Lab2: ROS

## Purpose
This lecture accompanies the introduction to ROS used in class. We will apply the knowledge you learned by interacting with a simulated TurlteBot3 Burger.

## ROS Introduction.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. ROS is sometimes called a meta operating system because it performs many functions of an operating system, but it requires a computer's operating system such as Linux.

Why? Because creating truly robust, general-purpose robot software is hard. From the robot's perspective, problems that seem trivial to humans often vary wildly between instances of tasks and environments. Dealing with these variations is so hard that no single individual, laboratory, or institution can hope to do it on their own.

As a result, ROS was built from the ground up to encourage collaborative robotics software development. For example, one laboratory might have experts in mapping indoor environments, and could contribute a world-class system for producing maps. Another group might have experts at using maps to navigate, and yet another group might have discovered a computer vision approach that works well for recognizing small objects in clutter. ROS was designed specifically for groups like these to collaborate and build upon each other's work, as is described throughout this site.

## Setting up the terminal for ROS
1. Open a new Linux terminal by pressing:

    `ctrl+alt+t`
    <br>
1. Change to your root directory:

    `cd`

    When the `cd` command has no arguments, it changes to the user's home directory. The command `cd ..` will move up one level.
    <br>
1. Print the working directory:

    `pwd`
    <br>
1. List the contents of the current directory:

    `ls`
    <br>
1. Change directory to your master_ws folder:

    `cd master_ws`
    <br>
1. List the contents of the current directory:

    `ls`
    <br>
1. Change directory to your devel folder:

    `cd devel`
    <br>
1. You should notice a setup.bash file in the devel folder. Source this file allowing you to call your ROS packages:

    `source setup.bash`
    <br> 
1. Open your .bashrc file (a script that is ran every time a new terminal instance is opened):

    `nano ~/.bashrc`

    The '~' character indicates the .bashrc file is in the user's home directory and allows us to access it from anywhere in the file system (would be the same as using the absolute path `nano /dfec/home/.bashrc` ).

1. Scroll to the bottom of the file. You should see a few lines of code such as the following:

    ```
        source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
        source ~/master_ws/devel/setup.bash
        export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/master_ws/src:/opt/ros/noetic/share
        export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master:11311
        export EDITOR='nano -w'
    ```
    <br>
    The first three lines set up the ROS environment allowing access to built-in packages and packages within your master workspace. Line 4 establishes which system hosts the ROS network. You can replace master with your robot, and the entire ROS network would run on your robot.
    Hit ctrl+s to save, then ctrl+x to exit.
    <br>
    You need to source (execute) the .bashrc file any time the file is changed (the .bashrc file is ran every time a new terminal is opened, but since we haven't opened a new terminal yet, we have to run it manually).
    <br>
    <br>
1. Execute the .bashrc file

    `source ~/.bashrc`

## Running the TurtleBot3 simulation
The best way to learn about ROS is through implementation, however, let's start off by playing around with a virtual TurtleBot3! The TurtleBot3 is a tool we will utilize throughout this course to apply and integrate robotics systems. Ultimately you will create a complex embedded robotics system to perform a specific dedicated task, such as navigating the halls of DFEC. But let's see if we can get the robot to drive around first.

1. In a terminal (**Pro tip:** ctrl+alt+t opens a new terminal window, while ctrl+shift+t opens a new terminal tab in an existing window) and initialize the ROS network:

    `roscore`

1. That terminal is now occupied. Open a new terminal tab/window and launch the TurtleBot3 gazebo launch file (A launch file is a way to run one or more nodes at once, we will learn about launch files later):

    `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch`

> ⌨️ **Syntax:** `roslaunch <package> <launchfile>`

 
3. Open another terminal tab/window and launch the following:

    `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch`

The launch files will run the nodes necessary to simulate our robot and opens two windows: Gazebo and rviz. Gazebo is a simulation tool that provides physics for our robot and enables the testing of algorithms prior to real-world implementation. You should see a TurtleBot3 sitting at (-2.0, -0.5) facing the positive x direction surrounded by a maze. Using the mouse, left-click and holding will pan, holding the scroll wheel will change the orientation of the camera, and scrolling will zoom in and out.

The second window is rviz, a tool that visualizes topics interacting in our system. You should see a number of red dots outlining the location of the obstacles in our simulation. These are objects detected by our LIDAR which is communicating over a scan topic. Using the mouse, left-click will change the orientation of the camera, holding the scroll wheel will pan, and scrolling will zoom in and out (would be nice if they were the same).

Don't worry! We will learn more about both of these tools at a later time.

Let's go ahead and take a look at what nodes and topics currently running in our system. 

The "!" character in front of the following commands allows us to run bash commands from the Jupyter NB and would **NOT** be used in the command line.


```python
rosnode list
```

There are five nodes running, the first two enable the Gazebo simulation, the third allows for the visualization of the simulated robot, the fourth is created every time *roscore* is ran and helps with communication in our network, and the last enables rviz.

Not too exciting yet, so lets see what topics are active.


```python
rostopic list
```

There are a lot of topics that are utilized to simulate our robot. Our real-world robot will eventually have most of these, such as **/cmd_vel**, **/imu**, and **/scan**. These are topics that allow us to communicate with some of the simulated hardware, such as the orientation sensor (/imu), LIDAR (/scan), and driving the robot (/cmd_vel). The rest of the topics enable visualization and movement within the simulation and can be ignored for now.

Another useful tool for visualizing nodes and topics is called *rqt_graph*:


```python
rqt_graph
```

All that is going on right now is Gazebo is publishing the position and scan data which rviz uses to visualize the robot. **Close your rqt_graph** and let's add another node to make things a bit more interesting. 

Earlier we saw the topic **/cmd_vel**. This is a topic used to send *Twist* messages to a robot. A *Twist* message includes linear and angular x, y, z values to move a robot in a 3-dimensional space (google `ROS twist message` for more information). Our robot only drives in 2-dimensions and the wheels can only move forward and backward, so we will only use the linear x (forward and backward) and angular z (turning) attributes of the *Twist* message. To drive our simulated robot, we need a node that can publish *Twist* messages to the **/cmd_vel** topic. Luckily, there is a pre-built node called Teleop_Twist_Keyboard that sends *Twist* messages using a keyboard!

Open a new terminal tab (select the terminal and press ctrl+shift+t) and run the following (**Pro tip**: in a Linux terminal if you type the first couple letters of a command and then hit tab it will autocomplete the command for you):

`rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`

> ⌨️ **Syntax:** `rosrun <package> <executable>`

To drive the robot use the 'x' key to decrease linear x speed to about .25 m/s and use the 'c' key to decrease angular z speed to about .5 rad/s. Now follow the directions to utilize the keyboard to drive the robot! You should see the robot move in the simulation.

Let's take a look at our rqt_graph to see if anything has changed.

```python
rqt_graph
```

You should now see the teleop_twist_keyboard node which sends messages over **/cmd_vel** topic to Gazebo. **Close the rqt_graph window**. Let's run through a number of commands that will provide you more information about your ROS network. You will use these throughout the course to determine what is going on in your ROS network.

## Common ROS commands

The `rosnode` command allows us to interact with nodes. Typing any ROS command followd by `--help` will provide information about that command:


```python
rosnode --help
```

Let's get some information about our new node, teleop_twist_keyboard:


```python
rosnode info /teleop_twist_keyboard
```

The output of the command lists the topics the node is publishing and subscribing to (here is where we can see it publishes on **/cmd_vel**).

The `rostopic` command interacts with topics.


```python
rostopic --help
```

Some of the common rostopic commands we will use in this course are `echo`, `hz`, `info`,  `type`, and `list`


```python
rostopic list
```

Let's get some information about the **/cmd_vel** topic.


```python
rostopic info /cmd_vel
```

From the output we can see what nodes are publishing and subscribing to the **/cmd_vel** topic.

Echoing the topic will allow us to see what messages are sent over the topic. After running the below command, browse back to your teleop_twist_keyboard node and drive the robot. You should see the twist messages sent to Gazebo.


```python
rostopic echo /cmd_vel
```

```{note}
When moving forward and backward ('i' and ',' keys) only a linear x value is sent, when turning left or right ('j' and 'l' keys) only an angular z value is sent, and when arcing ('u', 'o', 'm', and '.' keys) both a linear x and angular z value are sent.
```

```{note}
The previous command still has an `*` character to the left. This means this command is waiting for inputs and will block all future commands. To kill the command and restart the kernel in the Jupyter Notebook at the top menu bar select "Kernel" and "Restart & Clear Output". This will allow future commands to run.
```

To learn more about the messages sent over the **/cmd_vel** topic we can use the `type` command and the `rosmsg` tool.


```python
rostopic type /cmd_vel
```


```python
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
```

Or in one combined command:


```python
rostopic type /cmd_vel | rosmsg show
```

## Cleanup
Before moving on to the in-class exercise, close all running nodes. In the Jupyter Notebook at the top menu bar select "Kernel" and "Restart & Clear Output". In each terminal window, close the node by typing `ctrl+c`. Ensure roscore is terminated before moving on to the ICE.














## Deliverables

Below you will run ROS commands. The "!" character in the front allows us to run bash commands from Jupyter and would **NOT** be used in the command line.

With the client and server nodes running execute the below commands.

List all running nodes:


```python

```

List the active topics:


```python
 
```

Display running nodes and communication between them:


```python
 
```

Exit the rqt_graph.

Show information about a the **/client** topic such as what type of messages are sent over the topic and publishing and subscribing nodes.


```python
 
```

Display information about the message that is sent over the **/client** topic.


```python

```

Display messages sent over the **/client** topic:


```python

```

In the ICE3_Client notebook when you send a message you should see the message echoed above.

## Checkpoint
Once complete, take the necessary screen shots of all the items above functioning. Upload those screenshots to your repo in a Module03 folder within the master folder of your repo.

## Cleanup
In each of the notebooks reset the Jupter kernel and clear output. Close each notebook. Shutdown the notebook server by typing `ctrl+c` within the terminal you ran `jupyter-notebook` in. Select 'y'.




## Implementing the chat subscriber

### Import modules


```python
# import required modules
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String
```

## Listener
This function will create the subscriber ("listener") used to receive chat messages from the publisher ("talker").


```python
def listener():
    rospy.Subscriber('chat', String, callback_chat)
```

The above function creates the subscriber to the **/chat** topic. Every time a *String* message is sent over the topic the `callback_chat()` function is called. This is an interrupt that spins a new thread to call that function.

### Callback function
The callback function will log and display what the chat listener sent.


```python
def callback_chat(message):
    rospy.loginfo(rospy.get_caller_id() + " I heard %s", message.data)
```

The callback function receives the *String* message as an input (you can name this parameter anything, but it is helpful if it is a meaningful variable name). To access the actual message, we need to utilize the data attribute of the *String* message. If you browse to the documentation for the [String Mesage](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/String.html), you will note that the message attribute is called *data* and it is of type *string*. This is why we use the command `message.data`.

### Main


```python
def main():
    rospy.init_node('listener')
    try:
        listener()
        rospy.spin()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

The above is similar to the talker, but adds the `rospy.spin()` function call to create an infinite loop to allow the subscriber to operate in the background.

In an actual Python script we will replace 
```python
def main()
``` 
with 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```
This allows our python files to be imported into other python files that might also have a main() function.

### Run the listener


```python
main()
```

    [INFO] [1666756858.595079, 308.564000]: /listener I heard hello
    

At this point, the subscriber is waiting for the publisher to send a message. Browse back to your talker and type a message! You should see that message show up above after hitting `enter` in the talker Notebook.

## Talker

### A note on this document
This document is known as a Jupyter Notebook; it is used in academia and industry to allow text and executable code to coexist in a very easy to read format. Blocks can contain text or code, and for blocks containing code, press `Shift + Enter` to run the code. Earlier blocks of code need to be run for the later blocks of code to work.

### Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook will delve a little deeper into ROS implementation. You will create a basic one way chat server that allows a user to send messages to another (both users will be on the same computer at this point in time).

### Initialize ROS:
The first step when utilizing  ROS is to initialize *roscore*. There are two methods to accomplish this: first, by explicitly running *roscore* and second, by running a launch file (which will initialize *roscore* if it is not already running). During the first portion of this course we will explicitly run *roscore* and then take advantage of launch files later in the course.

Copy the following code and run it in a new terminal (use the shortcut `ctrl+alt+t` to open a new terminal window or select an open terminal and hit `ctrl+shift+t` to open a new terminal tab):

`roscore`

### Implementing the chat publisher
> 📝️ **Note:** The following is Python code that will be implemented within the Jupyter Notebook. Again, the Notebook is just a way to allow for code and text to coexist to help guide you through the ICE. You could take all of the code in this Notebook and put it within a Python file and it would work the same as it does here. The focus of this ICE is the ROS implementation. It is assumed you have a working knowledge of Python at this time so this Notebook will not go into a lot of background regarding the Python code. Module 3 will provide a Python refresher.

### Import modules

> ⚠️ **Important:** Importing classes may take some time. You will know the code block is still executing as the bracket on the left of the cell will change to a `*` character. Do not move to the next step until the `*` is gone.


```python
# import required modules
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String
```

Here, we have two modules, rospy and a message. The rospy module provides all ROS implementation to create nodes and publish messages on topics. The next line imports the String message from the std_msgs package which we will use to send our chat messages. The Standard ROS Messages include a number of common message types. You can find more information about these messages on the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs).

### Talker Function
One method to communicate in ROS is using a publisher/subscriber model. One node publishes messages over a topic and any other nodes can subscribe to this topic to receive the messages.

This function will create the publisher ("talker") used to send chat messages to the subscriber ("listener"). It will read user input and publish the message.


```python
def talker():
    chat_pub = rospy.Publisher('chat', String, queue_size = 1)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10) # 10 Hz
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        chat_str = input("Message: ")
        rospy.loginfo("I sent %s", chat_str)
        chat_pub.publish(chat_str)
        rate.sleep()
```

Line 2 creates the publisher. The publisher will publish *String* messages over the **/chat** topic. The `queue_size` parameter determines how many messages the ROS network will hold before dropping old messages. If the publisher publishes faster than the network can handle, then messages will start getting dropped.

Line 3 determines the rate at which the following loop should run. With an input of 10, the loop should run 10 times per second (10 Hz). Line 4 creates a loop that runs until `ctrl+c` is pressed in the terminal. Line 5 gets user input while line 6 logs the message into a log file (and prints it to the screen). Line 7 publishes the chat message using the previously created publisher. Lastly, line 8 sleeps so the loop runs at the desired rate.

> 📝️ **Note:** Waiting for user input will cause the loop to not run at 10 Hz as line 5 will block until the user hits enter.

### Main
The main function calls our talker function.


```python
def main():
    rospy.init_node('talker')
    try:
        talker()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

Line 2 of the above code initializes our talker node. The rest creates a try-except statement that calls our talker function. All the try/except really does is ensures we exit cleanly when ctrl+c is pressed in a terminal.

In an actual Python script we will replace 
```python
def main()
``` 
with 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```
This allows our python files to be imported into other python files that might also have a main() function.

### Run the talker


```python
main()
```

### Create the listener
At this point the talker is waiting for user input. Don't start typing yet, though! We need to implement and run our listener. 

### ROS commands

Note that the Jupyter code block for the `main()` function call on both the talker and listener has an `*` on the left side. That is due to the infinite loops in the talker and main functions. This means that those functions are blocking and no other Jupyter code blocks will run in these two notebooks. We have to open a new notebook to run the ROS commands we would use to investigate the state of our ROS system. This would be equivalent to opening a new terminal on the Linux computer. 



## ROS
Below you will see the ROS commands you will use throughout this course to investigate your ROS system and write your lab reports. The "!" character in the front allows us to run bash commands from Jupyter and would **NOT** be used in the command line.

With the talker and listener nodes running execute the below commands.

List all running nodes:


```
$ rosnode list
```

You should see the listener and talker nodes. The */rosout* node is created when running `roscore` and facilitates communication in the network. You can ignore this node in your lab reports.

Get more information about the */listener* node:


```
$ rosnode info /listener
```

You can see what topics the node is publishing and subscribing to. It publishes to the ROS log file (for debugging) and subscribes to the **/chat** topic.

List the active topics:


```
$ rostopic list
```

The first topic is the one we created. The last two are created by `roscore` and can be ignored.

Show information about the **/chat** topic such as what type of messages are sent over the topic and publishing and subscribing nodes.




```
$ rostopic info /chat
```

As expected, the *talker* node is publishing to the **/chat** topic while the *listener* node subscribes.

Display running nodes and communication between them:


```
$ rqt_graph
```

Close the rqt_graph.

Display information about the message that is sent over the **/chat** topic.


```
$ rostopic type /chat | rosmsg show
```

The output of the command is the same as the information we saw from the ROS documentation. Again, to access the message we have to use the `data` attribute.

Display messages sent over the **/chat** topic:


```
$ rostopic echo /chat
```

In the ICE1_Talker notebook send a message to the listener. You should see that message show up both here and at the listener. This echo tool is useful to ensure your nodes are sending the messages as expected.

## Checkpoint
Once complete, get checked off by an instructor showing the output of each of the above.

## Cleanup
In each of the notebooks reset the Jupyter kernel and clear output (at the top menu bar select "Kernel" and "Restart & Clear Output"). Close each notebook. Shutdown the notebook server by typing `ctrl+c` within the terminal you ran `jupyter-notebook` in. Select 'y'.
