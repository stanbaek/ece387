# 🔧 Robot Setup (2027)

This guide walks through the steps to install Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, ROS2 Jazzy, and all dependencies on a Raspberry Pi 4. This Pi is embedded within the Robotis TurtleBot3 Burger along with a USB camera. The robotics system, TurtleBot3, is utilized in the United States Air Force Academy's Electrical and Computer Engineering department to teach undergraduate students robotics.

This guide is adapted from the [TurtleBot3 e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#overview).

## TurtleBot3

Below is a list of recommended hardware and links. Other off-the-shelf components can replace the ones below.

- [TurtleBot3](https://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3/)
- [USB Camera](https://www.adesso.com/product/cybertrack-h4-1080p-hd-usb-webcam-with-built-in-microphone/) (Any USB Cam will work, this is the one we use)
- 128 GB High Speed MicroSD card
- Monitor, mouse, and keyboard
- If using an older version of the TurtleBot3 with a Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 3B+, you will need to purchase a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (preferably with 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM)

### Hardware Assembly

Follow the [Robotis e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/hardware_setup/#hardware-assembly) for hardware assembly stopping after installing the Raspberry Pi.

### Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi 4B with 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM is used throughout this curriculum. The RPi4 runs warm under load; ensure adequate cooling is in place. Heatsinks are recommended, and an active cooling fan significantly improves sustained performance. We used this 3D printed bracket to mount a fan.

### Camera

After installing the Raspberry Pi level of the TurtleBot3 you need to install the USB Camera Mount prior to finishing the robot build. The mount used in this course can be found in the [curriculum material](../stl/burger_usbcam_mount.stl) and is installed on two of the front standoffs on the TurtleBot3.

## Ubuntu Installation

### Download Ubuntu and flash MicroSD card

There are multiple ways to download and install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS to a MicroSD card, but the Raspberry Pi Imager is one of the easiest. Instructions for installing the imager on your operating system can be found on the [Raspberry Pi OS software page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

Once installed, start the imager and select **Raspberry Pi 4**.
<br>

```{image} ./figures/installer1.png
:width: 480
:align: center
```

<br>

Scroll down the menu and select **Other general purpose OS**.
<br>

```{image} ./figures/installer2.png
:width: 480
:align: center
```

<br>

Next, select **Ubuntu**.
<br>

```{image} ./figures/installer3.png
:width: 480
:align: center
```

<br>

Lastly, scroll and select the latest 64-bit version of **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit)**.

<br>

Now that you have the correct image selected, choose the storage device that corresponds to the MicroSD card.

Once complete you should have an Ubuntu SD card! Ensure your Raspberry Pi is powered off, connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and insert the SD card.

## Configuring Ubuntu

### Login and changing password

Once Ubuntu boots up you will be prompted to enter the login and password. It may take a few minutes on first boot to configure the default username and password, so if login fails, try again after a few minutes.

### Adding username

We need to create a new user named *pi* for students.

- Create the *pi* user:

    ```bash
    sudo adduser pi
    ```

    Enter an easy-to-remember password when prompted, then press Enter through the remaining prompts until you return to the terminal.

- Grant *sudo* privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo adduser pi sudo
    ```

- Switch to the new user:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

    Then log in using the *pi* account credentials.

- Once logged in as *pi*, your terminal prompt should show `pi@ubuntu:`. Confirm your current directory by running:

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

    This should display `/home/pi`.

### Change hostname

If you have multiple robots on your network it is good to give each a unique hostname. We number each robot from 0–n and each robot has a corresponding hostname (e.g., `robot0`).

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname robot0
```

The new hostname will not take effect until reboot. Don't reboot yet! There are a few more things to accomplish first.

### Set up Wi-Fi (Optional)

Until a desktop GUI is installed we have to work with the command line to set up Wi-Fi. This is the most reliable method and we will delete these changes once a GUI is installed.

- First, determine the name of your Wi-Fi network adapter:

    ```bash
    ip link
    ```

    Expected output (the built-in Wi-Fi adapter is typically **`wlan0`**):

    ```bash
    pi@ubuntu:~$ ip link
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: eth0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether e4:5f:01:15:5b:30 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether e4:5f:01:15:5b:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ```

- Open the `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
    ```

- Before editing the config, generate an encrypted PSK for each WPA2 network using `wpa_passphrase`. The PSK is derived from both the SSID and the passphrase, so each SSID requires its own hash even if the plain-text password is the same:

    ```bash
    wpa_passphrase YOUR-SSID your-plain-text-passphrase
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    network={
        ssid="YOUR-SSID"
        #psk="your-plain-text-passphrase"
        psk=3a7f2c1d9e4b8f0a6c5d2e1f7a3b9c4d8e2f1a0b6c3d7e9f2a1b4c8d0e5f3a7b
    }
    ```

    Copy the 64-character `psk=` value (without quotes) for use in the config below. The `#psk=` comment line is just a human-readable reminder and is not used.

- Edit the file (use spaces, not tabs). You can add multiple access points so the robot automatically connects to whichever network is in range. For open networks (no password), use `key-management: none`:

    ```yaml
    # This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
    # to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
    # network configuration capabilities, write a file
    # /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
    # network: {config: disabled}
    network:
      version: 2
      ethernets:
        eth0:
          optional: true
          dhcp4: true
          dhcp6: true
      wifis:
        wlan0:
          optional: true
          dhcp4: true
          regulatory-domain: "US"
          access-points:
            "YOUR-HOME-SSID":
              auth:
                key-management: "psk"
                password: "<64-char PSK from wpa_passphrase>"
            "AFAcademy_Guest":
              auth:
                key-management: "none"
    ```

    The Pi connects to whichever network is in range. If both are visible simultaneously, it picks based on signal strength.

- Save and exit, then apply:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

### Static IP Address (Optional)

It may be beneficial to set up a static IP address. First determine your subnet and gateway:

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ip route
default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 proto static
192.168.0.1/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.201
```

Then edit the Netplan config to set a static IP within the subnet range:

```yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      optional: true
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
  wifis:
    wlan0:
      optional: true
      dhcp4: false
      regulatory-domain: "US"
      addresses:
        - 192.168.0.208/24
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.0.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [192.168.0.1, 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
      access-points:
        "YOUR-HOME-SSID":
          auth:
            key-management: "psk"
            password: "<64-char PSK from wpa_passphrase>"
        "AFAcademy_Guest":
          auth:
            key-management: "none"
```

### Disable Automatic Updates

Ubuntu will attempt to apply system updates in the background. This has caused issues in the past with ROS dependencies and keys. Disabling automatic updates allows you to control when Ubuntu installs updates. While this is not a good habit for general computer security, it is fine for an embedded robotics system. Ensure you periodically update and upgrade your system manually.

- Open the auto updater configuration file:

    ```bash
    sudoedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
    ```

- Change the content from:

    ```bash
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
    ```

    to:

    ```bash
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0";
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
    APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
    APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
    ```

- Prevent boot-up delay when there is no network at startup:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
    ```

- Disable Suspend and Hibernation:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
    ```

- Reboot the Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

### Verify changes

After reboot, your new hostname should appear at the terminal (e.g., `pi@robot0`). Confirm Wi-Fi connectivity and IP address:

```bash
ip addr show wlan0
```

You can now SSH into the TurtleBot3 from another machine on the same network:

```bash
ssh pi@IP_ADDRESS
```

or, if your network provides Dynamic DNS:

```bash
ssh pi@HOSTNAME
```

### Update and Upgrade

Since we turned off automatic updates, periodically update and upgrade manually:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Install Ubuntu Desktop (optional)

A desktop GUI is **not** necessary for a remote machine like TurtleBot3 and will consume roughly 1.4 GB of RAM. If a GUI is needed:

```bash
sudo apt -y install ubuntu-desktop
```

If you install Ubuntu Desktop and want to use the GUI to configure Wi-Fi, remove the Wi-Fi settings from `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` first. The file should be restored to its minimal form:

```yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:
        wlan0:
             dhcp4: true
             optional: true
```

You can then use the GUI interface in the top-right of the screen to set up a Wi-Fi connection.

### Install RTL8723BU driver (Optional for Ubuntu 24.04, not fully tested)

We use a Wi-Fi dongle to create an access point, allowing a remote master computer to directly control the robot. The specific adapter is the [Xinghuatian Tech Combination WiFi + Bluetooth® 4.0 USB Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4827).

- Install build prerequisites:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y git dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    ```

- Remove any conflicting Realtek modules:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe -r rtw88_8723b 2>/dev/null
    sudo modprobe -r rtl8723bu 2>/dev/null
    ```

    (Optional) Verify no 8723 modules are loaded:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep 8723
    ```

- Install the RTL8723BU driver from <https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bu.git>:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bu.git
    cd rtl8723bu

    source dkms.conf

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION
    sudo cp -r core hal include os_dep platform dkms.conf Makefile rtl8723b_fw.bin \
        /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION

    sudo dkms add $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION
    sudo dkms autoinstall $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION
    ```

- Load the module and verify:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe rtl8723bu
    lsmod | grep 8723
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    8723bu               1048576  0
    cfg80211              970752  4 brcmfmac,mac80211,8723bu,rtl8xxxu
    ```

- Rename the interface: By default, `ip addr` shows the Wi-Fi dongle with a long hardware-derived name (e.g., `wlx1cbfcee6196b`). We standardize this to `wlan1` across all robots. On the Raspberry Pi 4, the built-in Wi-Fi will use `wlan0`, and the first USB dongle detected will use `wlan1`.

    Edit the boot configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    ```

    Stay on the same line — do not add a newline. Append a space followed by:

    ```bash
    net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0
    ```

    Save and reboot. After rebooting, your interfaces will no longer have long names like `wlx1cbfcee6196b`. The dongle will be `wlan1`.

---

## Dual Wi-Fi Setup (Client + Access Point)

The TurtleBot3 uses two independent Wi-Fi interfaces:

| Interface | Hardware                    | Role                      | Network             |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `wlan0`   | Built-in Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi | **Access Point (AP)**     | `robotXX` (SSID)    |
| `wlan1`   | USB Wi-Fi (RTL8723BU)       | **Client → router**       | Campus/lab network  |
| Master PC | Built-in & USB Wi-Fi        | Connects to AP + internet | `robotXX` + router  |

The master PC connects to the robot's AP (`wlan0`) for low-latency ROS2 communication while the robot uses `wlan1` for internet access. There is **no NAT or packet forwarding** between the two interfaces — the master PC maintains its own separate internet connection.

### Step 1: Verify Interfaces

Confirm both interfaces exist and the RTL8723BU driver is loaded:

```bash
ip link
lsmod | grep 8723
```

Expected:

```text
wlan0   ← built-in Wi-Fi (will become the AP)
wlan1   ← USB Wi-Fi dongle (client to router)
8723bu  ← driver loaded
```

### Step 2: Configure Wi-Fi Client (`wlan1`)

`wlan1` connects to the router for internet access via Netplan. The PSK is derived from both the SSID and passphrase, so generate an encrypted key for each WPA2 network with `wpa_passphrase`:

```bash
wpa_passphrase YOUR-SSID your-plain-text-passphrase
```

Copy the 64-character `psk=` value from the output (not the `#psk=` comment line).

Edit the Netplan configuration, replacing `wlan0` with `wlan1` and removing any prior `wlan0` entry. Multiple access points can be listed — the robot connects to whichever is in range:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      optional: true
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
  wifis:
    wlan1:
      optional: true
      dhcp4: true
      regulatory-domain: "US"
      access-points:
        "YOUR-HOME-SSID":
          auth:
            key-management: "psk"
            password: "<64-char PSK from wpa_passphrase>"
        "AFAcademy_Guest":
          auth:
            key-management: "none"
```

Apply and verify:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
sudo netplan apply
ip addr show wlan1   # should show inet 192.168.x.x
```

### Step 3: Assign Static IP to the AP Interface (`wlan0`)

`wlan0` will be managed entirely by `hostapd`, so it must **not** appear in the Netplan `wifis` section — Netplan would invoke `wpa_supplicant`, which conflicts with `hostapd`. Instead, assign the static IP via a `systemd-networkd` drop-in file.

`wlan0` has no wireless carrier until `hostapd` starts, so `ConfigureWithoutCarrier=yes` is required to assign the address before the AP is up:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0-ap.network
```

```ini
[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Link]
RequiredForOnline=no

[Network]
Address=192.168.50.1/24
ConfigureWithoutCarrier=yes
```

Apply and verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
ip addr show wlan0   # should show 192.168.50.1/24
```

### Step 4: Install hostapd and dnsmasq

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y hostapd dnsmasq
```

### Step 5: Configure dnsmasq (DHCP for AP Clients)

`dnsmasq` assigns IP addresses to devices that connect to the robot's AP. DNS is disabled — this is DHCP only.

```bash
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

```ini
interface=wlan0
bind-interfaces

# Disable DNS (DHCP only)
port=0

# 72-hour lease for student labs
dhcp-range=192.168.50.10,192.168.50.50,255.255.255.0,72h
```

### Step 6: Configure hostapd (AP)

Instead of hard-coding the SSID, generate the `hostapd` config from the hostname at boot so that cloned SD cards work without manual edits.

Create the template:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.template
```

```ini
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211

ssid=__HOSTNAME__

# 5 GHz / 802.11ac
hw_mode=a
channel=36
ieee80211n=1
ieee80211ac=1
country_code=US

# WPA2 security
auth_algs=1
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=YOUR-AP-PASSWORD
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
```

> **Note:** Replace `YOUR-AP-PASSWORD` with a shared passphrase that all master computers will use to connect to the robot AP. This passphrase is the same for all robots and is not SSID-derived, so it can be set directly here (no `wpa_passphrase` hashing needed).

Create the generator script that substitutes `__HOSTNAME__` at boot:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/gen-hostapd-conf.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
sed "s/__HOSTNAME__/${HOSTNAME}/g" \
    /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.template \
    > /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gen-hostapd-conf.sh
```

Tell `hostapd` where its config lives:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```

```ini
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```

### Step 7: Systemd Service — Auto-generate SSID from Hostname

Create a one-shot service that runs the generator before `hostapd` starts on every boot:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/hostapd-genconf.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Generate hostapd config from hostname
Before=hostapd.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gen-hostapd-conf.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd, enable all services, and start the AP:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable hostapd-genconf.service
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd dnsmasq
```

Generate the hostapd config manually for the first run (on subsequent boots the `hostapd-genconf.service` handles this automatically):

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/gen-hostapd-conf.sh
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart hostapd dnsmasq
```

Verify the AP is running:

```bash
systemctl status hostapd
```

A successful output looks like this. Confirm that the `Active:` line shows **active (running)** and that `wlan0: AP-ENABLED` appears near the bottom:

```bash
● hostapd.service - Access point and authentication server for Wi-Fi and Ethernet
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/hostapd.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2026-06-14 07:11:08 MDT; 12s ago
       Docs: man:hostapd(8)
   Main PID: 2326 (hostapd)
Jun 14 07:11:08 robot99 hostapd[2300]: wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->COUNTRY_UPDATE
Jun 14 07:11:08 robot99 hostapd[2300]: wlan0: interface state COUNTRY_UPDATE->ENABLED
Jun 14 07:11:08 robot99 hostapd[2300]: wlan0: AP-ENABLED
Jun 14 07:11:08 robot99 systemd[1]: Started hostapd.service - Access point and authentication server for Wi-Fi and Ethernet
```

### Step 8: Prevent cloud-init from Resetting the Hostname

By default, cloud-init resets the hostname on every boot, which would break the auto-SSID feature. Disable this behavior in two places:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-hostname.cfg
```

```yaml
preserve_hostname: true
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
```

Find and change `preserve_hostname: false` to:

```yaml
preserve_hostname: true
```

### Final Verification

Reboot, then confirm everything is working:

```bash
hostname                   # e.g., robot42
ip addr show wlan0         # should show 192.168.50.1/24
ip addr show wlan1         # should show router-assigned IP
systemctl status hostapd   # should show AP-ENABLED
systemctl status dnsmasq   # should show active (running)
```

From the master computer, connect to the robot's AP (SSID matches the hostname, e.g., `robot42`), then SSH in:

```bash
ssh pi@192.168.50.1
```

## ROS2 Jazzy

At this point, the Ubuntu environment is set up. Now we will set up the ROS requirements for the TurtleBot3. All instructions are adapted from the [ROS2 Jazzy Installation Docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) and [The Robotics Back-End](https://roboticsbackend.com/install-ros2-on-raspberry-pi/). ROS 2 Jazzy is the LTS version of ROS 2 that supports Ubuntu 24.04.

### Installation

#### Set locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8:

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

#### Enable required repositories

Ensure the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled:

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

The official ROS 2 installation now uses the `ros2-apt-source` package to configure the ROS 2 repository and GPG keys automatically. Updates to the repository configuration will be handled automatically when new versions of this package are released.

Install the `ros2-apt-source` package:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
export ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/latest | grep -F "tag_name" | awk -F'"' '{print $4}')
curl -L -o /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb "https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/download/${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}/ros2-apt-source_${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}.$(. /etc/os-release && echo ${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-${VERSION_CODENAME}})_all.deb"
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb
```

#### Verify apt sources include noble-updates

On a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 install, the apt sources may only include the base `noble` and `noble-security` suites. This causes dependency conflicts when installing ROS 2 packages, because security-patched library versions (e.g., `liblz4-1`, `libzstd1`, `zlib1g`) end up mismatched against what ROS expects. Check before proceeding:

```bash
grep Suites /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
```

The file contains two stanzas. Check that the **first** stanza (main packages) includes `noble-updates` and `noble-backports` — not just the second (security) stanza. If the first stanza's `Suites:` line only shows `noble`, edit the file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
```

Update the first stanza's `Suites:` line to:

```yaml
Suites: noble noble-updates noble-backports
```

Then bring the system fully up to date:

```bash
sudo apt clean && sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

#### Install ROS 2 Jazzy

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ros-base
```

The base version provides the bare bones of ROS 2 — minimum packaging, build, and communications libraries with no GUI tools. As the Raspberry Pi is embedded into TurtleBot3 it is ideal to keep overhead as low as possible.

#### Install colcon

```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

### Install ROS2 and TurtleBot3 Packages

Install core build tools and TurtleBot3 ROS2 dependencies — drivers and message definitions for LiDAR, motors, URDF, and USB devices:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete python3-colcon-common-extensions libboost-system-dev build-essential
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-hls-lfcd-lds-driver
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-msgs
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-dynamixel-sdk
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-xacro
sudo apt install libudev-dev
```

Initialize `rosdep`, which resolves and installs ROS package dependencies from `package.xml` files. This is a one-time system-wide setup:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### USB Port Setting for OpenCR

This installs a udev rule so the OpenCR board (TurtleBot3's motor controller) is accessible over USB without `sudo` and with consistent permissions. Safe to run more than once — it simply overwrites the same file with the same content.

```bash
sudo cp `ros2 pkg prefix turtlebot3_bringup`/share/turtlebot3_bringup/script/99-turtlebot3-cdc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Install Software for ECE 387

Install USB camera drivers, OpenCV, and AprilTag libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3.12-venv
sudo apt install -y ros-jazzy-usb-cam ros-jazzy-image-proc
sudo apt install -y ros-jazzy-v4l2-camera
sudo apt install -y python3-opencv python3-numpy ros-jazzy-cv-bridge
sudo apt install -y tree
sudo apt install -y libapriltag-dev python3-dev cmake libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential
sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev
```

### Raspberry Pi Camera Module (Optional / Experimental)

> ⚠️ **Experimental:** The RPi Camera Module requires `libcamera` and additional configuration. Compatibility with Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS2 Jazzy has improved significantly over Ubuntu 22.04, but setup is more involved than a USB webcam. Test thoroughly before deploying in a course setting. The USB webcam remains the recommended camera for ECE 387.

This section covers setup for the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 (Sony IMX219, 8 MP) or v3 (Sony IMX708, 12 MP with autofocus). Both use the CSI ribbon cable interface and the `libcamera` stack rather than the V4L2/USB path used by the Adesso webcam.

#### Step 1: Enable the CSI camera in firmware

Edit the Raspberry Pi firmware config:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Find or add the following line under the `[all]` section:

```ini
camera_auto_detect=1
```

`camera_auto_detect=1` works for both v2 and v3 — the firmware detects which module is attached automatically. To pin a specific module instead:

```ini
# Camera Module v2 (IMX219)
dtoverlay=imx219

# Camera Module v3 (IMX708)
dtoverlay=imx708
```

If images appear corrupted or the camera fails to initialize, also set:

```ini
gpu_mem=128
```

Reboot after any `/boot/firmware/config.txt` changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 2: Install libcamera tools

On Ubuntu 24.04 for Raspberry Pi, try `rpicam-apps` first; fall back to `libcamera-apps` if the package is not found:

```bash
sudo apt install -y rpicam-apps libcamera-dev
# If rpicam-apps is unavailable:
# sudo apt install -y libcamera-apps libcamera-dev
```

#### Step 3: Verify the camera is detected

List detected cameras:

```bash
rpicam-hello --list-cameras
```

Capture a test image:

```bash
rpicam-still -o ~/test.jpg
```

If you get `No cameras available`, check the CSI ribbon cable orientation and the `config.txt` entry, then reboot.

#### Step 4: Install the ROS2 camera-ros package

`camera-ros` is the ROS2 wrapper for `libcamera`. It publishes camera frames as `sensor_msgs/Image` topics, compatible with the ECE 387 perception pipeline:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-jazzy-camera-ros
```

#### Step 5: Launch the camera node

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run camera_ros camera_node
```

By default this publishes on `/camera/image_raw`. Verify with:

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic hz /camera/image_raw
```

#### Switching from the USB webcam

The USB webcam uses `ros-jazzy-usb-cam` or `ros-jazzy-v4l2-camera`. Replacing it with `camera_ros` keeps the same topic name and message type (`sensor_msgs/Image`), so the AprilTag and stop sign detection nodes should work without modification.

### Updating OpenCR Firmware

The last step is updating the firmware for the OpenCR controller board.

Ref: <https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup/#opencr-setup>

- Install required packages:

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libc6:armhf
    ```

- Download and extract the firmware:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR-Binaries/raw/master/turtlebot3/ROS2/latest/opencr_update.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf ./opencr_update.tar.bz2
    ```

- Set the OpenCR model name:

    ```bash
    export OPENCR_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
    export OPENCR_MODEL=burger
    ```

- Upload firmware to the OpenCR:

    ```bash
    cd ~/opencr_update
    ./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr
    ```

    A successful firmware upload looks like:

    ```bash
    pi@robot99: ~/Downloads/opencr_update
    $ ./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr
    aarch64
    arm
    OpenCR Update Start..
    opencr_ld_shell ver 1.0.0
    opencr_ld_main
    [  ] file name          : burger.opencr
    [  ] file size          : 136 KB
    [  ] fw_name            : burger
    [  ] fw_ver             : V230127R1
    [OK] Open port          : /dev/ttyACM0
    [  ]
    [  ] Board Name         : OpenCR R1.0
    [  ] Board Ver          : 0x17020800
    [  ] Board Rev          : 0x00000000
    [OK] flash_erase        : 0.95s
    [OK] flash_write        : 1.31s
    [OK] CRC Check          : D92222 D92222 , 0.004000 sec
    [OK] Download
    [OK] jump_to_fw
    ```

- If not successful, refer to the [OpenCR Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup/#opencr-setup) guide for debug methods.

## Per-User Setup

> Repeat every step in this section for each user account on the robot. Complete the system-wide sections above first, then switch to each user account (e.g., `pi`) and run through this section again.

### Configure ROS2 Environment

Ref: <https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html>

Add ROS environment setup to `~/.bashrc` so it is sourced automatically in every new shell:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify the environment variables are set correctly:

```bash
printenv | grep -i ROS
```

Expected:

```bash
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_DISTRO=jazzy
```

Set the ROS Domain ID. ROS 2 nodes on the same domain ID can communicate freely; nodes on different IDs cannot. Choose X to match the robot number (e.g., `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=9` for `robot99`):

```bash
echo "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Build ROS2 Workspace

Clone the TurtleBot3 repositories and build the workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/robot_ws/src && cd ~/robot_ws/src
git clone -b jazzy https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
git clone -b jazzy https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/ld08_driver.git
git clone -b jazzy https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/coin_d4_driver
```

Remove unused navigation packages to reduce build time and memory usage:

```bash
cd ~/robot_ws/src/turtlebot3
rm -r turtlebot3_cartographer turtlebot3_navigation2
```

Build and source the workspace:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cd ~/robot_ws
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers 1
echo 'source ~/robot_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### LDS and TurtleBot3 Configuration

The TurtleBot3 LDS has been updated to LDS-02 since 2022. For TurtleBots purchased after 2022, use LDS-02 for the `LDS_MODEL`.

```{image} ./figures/lds_small.png
:width: 420
:align: center
```

<br>

```bash
echo 'export LDS_MODEL=LDS-02' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Python Virtual Environment

Ubuntu 24.04 enforces [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/), which prevents pip from installing into the system Python. Use a virtual environment instead. The `--system-site-packages` flag makes ROS2's Python packages (installed via apt into `/opt/ros/jazzy/`) visible inside the venv.

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/robot_env --system-site-packages
source ~/robot_env/bin/activate
```

Add the following to `~/.bashrc` so the environment activates automatically on login:

```bash
echo "source ~/robot_env/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Optionally, make the venv name appear in yellow in the prompt:

```bash
PS1="(\[\e[33m\]robot_env\[\e[0m\]) \u@\h:\w\$ "
```

### Python Packages

Install common Python libraries used in perception and vision labs:

```bash
pip install "pydantic<2" scipy
pip install scikit-build cmake
pip install pupil-apriltags
```

For `dlib`, build a wheel once and distribute it to avoid recompiling on every robot (30–60 minutes per compile). If you already have a `.whl` file, skip to step 3.

1. Build the wheel (run once on one robot):

    ```bash
    pip install wheel
    pip download dlib
    python3 -m pip wheel dlib-*.tar.gz
    ```

    This produces a file like `dlib-20.0.0-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl`.

2. Transfer the wheel to other robots:

    ```bash
    scp dlib-*.whl pi@robotX:~/
    ```

3. Install the wheel (on every robot, for every user):

    ```bash
    pip install ~/dlib-*.whl
    ```

### Camera Permissions

Grant the current user access to `/dev/video*` devices:

```bash
sudo adduser $USER video
```

Then reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### GitHub SSH Keys

The following assumes you already have a GitHub account.

- Create SSH keys using the same email as your GitHub login:

    ```bash
    cd
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github@email.com"
    ```

    When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", press **Enter**.

- Start the ssh-agent and add your private key:

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

- Open the public key (easiest via an SSH connection from a desktop machine so you can copy it):

    ```bash
    nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    Copy the entire contents of the file.

- In GitHub, go to **Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**. Add a descriptive title (e.g., `robot99`), paste the key, and click **Add SSH key**.

### Installing Dependencies for New Packages

Whenever you or a student clones a new ROS2 package into `~/robot_ws/src`, run `rosdep install` to automatically install any missing dependencies declared in its `package.xml`:

```bash
cd ~/robot_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Then rebuild the workspace:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers 1
source ~/.bashrc
```
