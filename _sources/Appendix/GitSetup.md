
# ðŸ”§ Git Repo Setup


## Purpose
Setup GIT repositories and access on the **Master**.

```{note}
Donâ€™t worry if it doesnâ€™t work right. If everything did, youâ€™d be out of a job.
```

(CreateRepo)=
### Create a Repository within the GitHub Classroom

1. If you donâ€™t already have a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account, create one. Itâ€™s best if your username is something identifiable (e.g., `stanbaek`).  

1. Once your account is ready, go to the <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/gHikuWHu" target="_blank">ECE387 Classroom</a>.  

1. Your afacademy email address has been preloaded to make joining easy. While I prefer your school email address, you may use another email if desired. For this, click `Skip to the next step`:  

    ```{image} ./figures/GitClassroom_SelectIdentifier.png  
    :width: 480  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  

1. Select `Accept this assignment`.  

1. Navigate to your repository and note the repository URL. Save this linkâ€”itâ€™s the easiest way to check if your repository is updated.  

1. Go to `Settings` and change your repository name to `ece387-lastname` (e.g., `ece387-baek`).  

    ```{important}  
    Please name your repository as `ece387-lastname` (all lowercase). This makes it easier for instructors to locate your repository.  
    ```  

(GitHubSSHKey)=
## Set Up GitHub SSH Key on Master  

This section assumes you already have a GitHub account.  

1. Create an SSH key for your GitHub account by running the following command. Use the same email as your GitHub login:  

    ```bash  
    $ cd  
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@email.com"  
    ```  

1. When prompted to specify a file path, press `Enter` to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).  

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background and add your SSH private key:  

    ```bash  
    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  
    ```  

1. Open the public key using your favorite terminal-based text editor. This step is easier via an SSH connection from a GUI-based desktop machine, as it allows you to copy the public key to your GitHub account:  

    ```bash  
    $ nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  
    ```  

1. Copy the entire contents of the file. Maximize the window to ensure you donâ€™t miss anything, including the GitHub email.  

1. Open a web browser and log in to your GitHub account.  

1. In the top-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then select **Settings**:  

    ```{image} ./figures/ssh1.png  
    :width: 180  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  

1. In the settings sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**:  

    ```{image} ./figures/ssh2.png  
    :width: 180  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  

1. Click **New SSH key**:  

    ```{image} ./figures/ssh3.png  
    :width: 600  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  

1. In the `Title` field, provide a descriptive label for the key, such as `master0`.  

1. Paste the copied key (from the `.pub` file) into the `Key` field.  

1. Click **Add SSH key** to save it.  

(CloneRepo)=
## Clone Repository to Your Master  

1. On the **Master**, open your GitHub repository and copy the repository address using the **SSH** mode:  

    ```{image} ./figures/GitClone.png  
    :width: 600  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  

1. Open a terminal and create a workspace source folder:  
    ```bash  
    $ mkdir -p ~/master_ws/src/  
    $ cd ~/master_ws/src  
    ```  

1. Clone your repository:  
    ```bash  
    $ git clone git@github.com:ECE387/ece387_lastname.git  
    ```  

1. Update your Git email address and name:  
    ```bash  
    $ git config user.email "you@example.com"  
    $ git config user.name "FirstName LastName"  
    ```  

1. Move into your repository you just cloned:  
    ```bash  
    $ cd ece387-lastname  
    ```  

1. Use the `touch` command to create an empty file called `COLCON_IGNORE`. This file ensures that this directory will be ignored when compiling ROS packages.

1. Run the following command to append your full name and section to a file named `README.md`. Since the file does not exist, it will be created automatically:
    ```bash  
    $ echo "# Your full name, Section" >> README.md  
    ```  

1. Verify that the file was created correctly by running:  
    ```bash  
    $ cat README.md  
    ```  
    If the file was created successfully, you should see output similar to the following:
    ```{image} ./figures/GitCreateReadmeFile.png  
    :width: 300  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>  
1. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository:
    ```bash  
    $ git add -A 
    $ git commit -m"initial commit"
    $ git push  
    ```  


(UpstreamRepo)=
## Setup Upstream Repository  

1. Open a Terminal and navigate to your local repository, such as 
    ```bash
    $ cd  ~/master_ws/src/ece387_lastname
    ```

1. Ensure your local repository is up to date with the remote GitHub repository by running
    
    ```bash
    $ git pull 
    ```

1. Verify that all your local changes have been committed and pushed to the remote GitHub repository by running
    ```bash
    $ git status 
    ```
    If your repository is clean, you should see the following message:
    ```bash
    On branch main
    No commits yet
    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    ```
    If you see uncommitted changes, make sure to commit and push them to the remote repository before proceeding.

1. Check your current remote repositories by typing
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    You should see two lines showing that `origin` points to your remote repository on GitHub for both fetching and pushing. 

1. Add the instructor's repository as additional remote source by running

    ```bash
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ECE-387/labs.git
    $ git config pull.rebase true
    ```
1. Verify that the upstream repository has been added successfully by typing 
    ``` bash
    git remote -v
    ``` 
    You should now see two additional lines indicating `upstream` is the original repository you forked from.

    ```{image} ./figures/GitAddUpstream.gif
    :width: 640
    :align: center
    ```
    <br>

1. If the instructor updates the code, you will be notified. To get the latest updates from the upstream repository, run
    ```bash
    git pull upstream main
    ``` 

1. By default, when you push or pull your code, `origin` will be used, which points to your own GitHub repository.
    ```{image} ./figures/FetchUpstream.png
    :width: 320
    :align: center
    ```

## Create a Team Repository within GitHub Classroom

```{important}
Only one person per group should complete these steps.
```

1. Visit the [GitHub Classroom Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/kJc_PfII).
1. Click `Create team` and select `Accept this assignment`.
1. Navigate to your repository and go to `Settings`. Change your repository name to `ece387-lastname_lastname` (e.g., `ece387-baek_pirate`).

    ```{important}
    Please name your repository as `ece387-lastname_lastname` (all lowercase). This makes it easier for instructors to locate your repository.
    ```

1. Go to `Settings` > `Collaborators and teams` > `Manage access`.
1. Invite your partners by entering their GitHub usernames.
1. If you are using a different computer from the previous labs, go to [this section](GitHubSSHKey) to set up a new SSH key for the remote GitHub repository.
1. Clone your repository. Ensure that the name of your local repository is `ece387_ws` by running:

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:ECE387/ece387_lastname_lastname.git ~/master_ws/src/ece387_ws
    ```
