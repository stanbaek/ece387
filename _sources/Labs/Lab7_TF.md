# ðŸ”¬ Lab7: Transformation

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Students should be able to explain the concept of coordinate transformation between global and local frames.
- Students should be able to implement a method to reset local coordinates without restarting the TurtleBot3.
- Students should be able to apply the rotational transformation matrix to convert coordinates between different frames.
- Students should be able to utilize IMU and odometry sensor data to determine the robotâ€™s pose.
- Students should be able to develop and test a ROS2 service to reset the TurtleBot3â€™s pose programmatically.
- Students should be able to debug and troubleshoot coordinate transformation issues in a real-world robotic system.


## ðŸ“œ Overview

In this lab, we will learn how to transform coordinates from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system. When you power on the TurtleBot3, its initial position and orientation (pose) are automatically set to zero. However, if you want to start a new task after completing a previous one, the initial pose will no longer be zero.

To reset the pose, you could power-cycle the robot or press the reset button on the OpenCR board, but this also requires restarting `bringup`, which is not always convenient. Instead, we will implement a method to reset the local coordinates without having to restart the board.

As discussed in the lecture, a coordinate transformation allows us to express a pointâ€™s position in one frame relative to another. The rotational matrix that rotates Frame {B} with respect to Frame {A} by an angle $\theta$ in a 2D space is given by:

$${}^{A}R_B = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix} $$

Using this transformation, a position $\mathbf{p}$ in the figure above can be represented in both Frame {A} (the global frame) and Frame {B} (the local frame). The coordinate transformation equation is:

$$\begin{bmatrix} {}^{A}x \\ {}^{A}y \end{bmatrix} = {}^{A}R_B  \begin{bmatrix} {}^{B}x \\ {}^{B}y \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} $$

where:
- $[{}^{A}x \quad {}^{A}y]^\top$ represents the position in the global frame, measured by the TurtleBot's IMU and odometry sensors.
- $[{}^{B}x \quad {}^{B}y]^\top$ represents the position in the local frame, which we aim to determine.
- $\theta$ is the orientation of Frame {B} relative to Frame {A}.
- $[x \quad y]^\top$ represents the displacement between Frame {A} and Frame {B}.

To find the local coordinates $[{}^{B}x \quad {}^{B}y]^\top$, we rearrange the equation:

$$\begin{bmatrix} {}^{B}x \\ {}^{B}y \end{bmatrix} = R^{-1} \left(\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} {}^{A}x \\ {}^{A}y \end{bmatrix}\right)$$

The orientation with respect to Frame {B}, ${}^{B}\theta$, can be obtained by ${}^{B}\theta = {}^{A}\theta - \theta$ as illustrated in the figure below

```{image} ./figures/Lab7_Orientation.png
:width: 300
:align: center
```

This transformation allows us to reset the local coordinates programmatically rather than manually restarting the TurtleBot3, making our system more efficient and flexible.

### Non-Interactive SSH Sessions

Sometimes, we need to execute commands remotely without logging into the remote host via SSH. Here's how you can run commands remotely from your local computer:

1. Run the following command on your master computer:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'ls -la'
    ```
    Here, X is the number assigned to your robot. This command will display the files and directories in the `pi` user's home directory, allowing us to execute commands on the remote computer without actually logging into it.

2. Try running this command next:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID'
    ```
    You may notice that it returns an empty string, even though we have already defined `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` inside the `.bashrc` file. To verify itâ€™s defined correctly, run:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'cat ~/.bashrc'
    ```
    Look for the line:
    ```sh 
    export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=99
    ```
    It confirms that `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is defined correctly in the `.bashrc` file.

3. At the beginning of the `.bashrc` file, you will find the following lines:
    ```sh
    # If not running interactively, don't do anything
    case $- in
        *i*) ;;
          *) return;;
    esac
    ```
    This code prevents the `.bashrc` file from executing if the shell is not in interactive mode. Since our `ssh` command runs in non-interactive mode, this code skips the rest of the `.bashrc` file. When you log into the host computer via SSH, the shell is in interactive mode, and all commands are executed normally.

4. Open Visual Studio Code (`VS Code`) and click on the `Extensions` icon on the left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Type `remote` and select `Remote-SSH`. Install it if itâ€™s not already installed.

5. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or navigating to `View > Command Palette`. Type the first few letters of `Remote-SSH` and select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host`. Enter `pi@robotX` and hit Enter. Type the password if prompted, though it should be password-free if youâ€™ve set up an SSH key. It may take a couple of minutes to set up the `vscode server` on the remote computer for the first time.

6. Click `Explorer` on the left sidebar, choose `/home/pi` for the `Open Folder` option, and hit OK. You should now see all the files in the home directory. Click on `.bashrc` to open it. Replace the following lines:
    ```sh
    # If not running interactively, don't do anything
    case $- in
        *i*) ;;
          *) return;;
    esac
    ```
    with:
    ```bash
    # If not running interactively, set the following environment variables
    if [[ $- != *i* ]]; then
        source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
        source ~/robot_ws/install/setup.bash
        export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
        export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=98     # TURTLEBOT3
        export LDS_MODEL=LDS-02
        return
    fi
    ```
    Ensure that `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=98` is set with your domain ID. Save the file.

7. On a terminal, try:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID'
    ```
    It should now return your domain ID.

### Running `robot.launch.py` without SSH into the Robot

Previously, to drive a physical TurtleBot3, we had to log into the remote host using SSH and run `ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py`. Here, we will implement a more convenient method to accomplish the same task without logging into the remote computer:

1. On a terminal, run:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py'
    ```
    This command remotely starts the `robot.launch.py` script on the TurtleBot3.

1. To simplify this process, add the following alias to the `.bashrc` file on your `master` computer:
    ```bash
    alias bringup='ssh pi@robotX '\''ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py'\'
    ```

1. Apply the changes by sourcing the `.bashrc` file or restarting the terminal. Now, simply run:
    ```bash
    $ bringup
    ```
    This alias will allow you to run the `robot.launch.py` script on your TurtleBot3 without needing to log into the remote computer each time.

1. To verify that the launch file is running correctly, check the active ROS nodes on the `master` computer:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 node list
    ```
    If the expected nodes are running, your setup is correct.

<!--
1. (Optional) If you need to stop the launch file remotely, you can use:
    ```bash
    $ ssh pi@robotX 'pkill -f robot.launch.py'
    ```
    This will terminate the running launch process on the TurtleBot3.
-->

Following these steps will ensure a seamless and efficient workflow for launching ROS2 on your TurtleBot3 without needing manual SSH logins each time.

## ðŸ’» Lab Procedure

### **Creating a New ROS2 Package**

Follow these steps to set up a new ROS2 package for this lab:

1. **Navigate to Your Workspace:** Open a terminal and move into the `ece387_ws` directory within your ROS2 workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/master_ws/src/ece387_ws
   ```

1. **Create a New ROS2 Package:** Use the following command to create a new package named `lab7_tf` with the BSD-3 license:
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license BSD-3-Clause lab7_tf
   ```

1. **Copy the `move2goal.py` Script:** Copy the `move2goal.py` file from Lab 6 into the `ece387_ws/lab7_tf/lab7_tf/` directory and rename it to `move2goal_tf.py`

1. **Add Dependencies:** Edit `package.xml` to include the following dependencies:
   ```xml
   <depend>rclpy</depend>
   <depend>geometry_msgs</depend>
   <depend>nav2_msgs</depend>
   <depend>sensor_msgs</depend>
   <depend>std_srvs</depend>
   ```

1. **Modify `setup.py`:** Update the `entry_points` section to include the `move2goal_tf` script:
   ```python
   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'move2goal_tf = lab7_tf.move2goal_tf:main',
       ],
   },
   ```

### **Implementing the Service Server**

1. **Import Required Libraries:**  Open `move2goal_tf.py` and add the following imports:
   ```python
   from std_srvs.srv import Empty
   from nav2_msgs.srv import SetInitialPose
   import math
   ```

1. **Create a Service Server:** Add the following service server inside the `__init__` method:
   ```python
    # TODO: Create a service server that will handle '/set_pose' service requests
    # - Service type: 'SetInitialPose'
    # - Service name: '/set_pose'
    # - Callback function: 'self.set_pose_callback' to execute when the service is called
    self.reset_service = 0 # Update this line.
   ```

1. **Update Position Variables:** Replace the following lines in the `__init__` method
    ```python
    # Variables to store the robot's current position and orientation
    self.x = 0.0    # Current x-coordinate
    self.y = 0.0    # Current y-coordinate
    self.yaw = 0.0  # Current orientation (yaw angle in radians)
    ```
    with

    ```python
    # Local Position Variables (Start at 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    self.local_x = 0.0
    self.local_y = 0.0
    self.local_yaw = 0.0

    # Variables for previous position to compute displacement
    self.initial_global_x = None
    self.initial_global_y = None
    self.initial_global_yaw = None
    ```

1. **Define the Callback Function:** Implement the service callback function to reset the local pose:
    ```python
    def set_pose_callback(self, request: SetInitialPose.Request, response: Empty.Response) -> Empty.Response:
        """
        Resets the local position coordinates to zero and clears the previous position coordinates.
        """

        # Reset the local position coordinates
        self.local_x = request.pose.pose.pose.position.x
        self.local_y = request.pose.pose.pose.position.y

        # Convert Quaternion to Euler Angles (Extract Yaw)
        q = request.pose.pose.pose.orientation
        quaternion = [q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w]
        _, _, self.local_yaw = euler_from_quaternion(quaternion)

        # Reset the state
        self.state = "ROTATE_TO_GOAL"

        # Clear the previous position coordinates
        # This ensures that any previous position data is discarded
        self.initial_global_x = None
        self.initial_global_y = None
        self.initial_global_yaw = None

        # Log a message to indicate the local position has been reset
        self.get_logger().info(f"Local pose set to x={self.local_x}, y={self.local_y}, yaw={self.local_yaw}.")

        # Return the response to the service caller
        return response
    ```

1. **Test the Service:** First, run the node:
   ```bash
   ros2 run lab7_tf move2goal_tf
   ```
   Then, in another terminal, call the service:
   ```bash
   ros2 service call /set_pose nav2_msgs/srv/SetInitialPose "{pose: {pose: {pose: {position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}}}}"
   ```
   You should see a confirmation message indicating that the local pose has been reset.

### **Implementing the Service Client**

1. **Modify `gamepad.py`:** Import the required libraries:
   ```python
   from std_srvs.srv import Empty
   from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseWithCovarianceStamped
   import math
   ```

1. **Create a Service Client:** Inside the `__init__` method, add:
   ```python
    # TODO: Create a service client to call the '/set_pose' service
    # - Service type: 'SetInitialPose'
    # - Service name: '/set_pose'
    self.reset_pose_client = 0  # Update this line
   ```

1. **Call the Service on Button Press:** Modify `joy_callback` to call the reset function when the Y button is pressed:
    ```python
    # Check if button 2 (Y) is pressed to reset the pose
    if msg.buttons[2]:
        self.send_set_pose_request(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)  # Call the reset_pose service
    ```

1. **Define the Request Function:** Implement `send_set_pose_request`:
    ```python
    def send_set_pose_request(self, x:float, y:float, theta:float):
        """
        Calls the 'reset_pose' service to reset the robot's pose.
        """
        # Check if the service is available
        if not self.reset_pose_client.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().warn("Service 'reset_pose' not available.")
            return

        # Create a request object 
        request = SetInitialPose.Request()
        request.pose = PoseWithCovarianceStamped()  

        # Set Header
        request.pose.header.frame_id = "map"
        request.pose.header.stamp = self.get_clock().now().to_msg()

        # TODO: Set Position
        

        # TODO: Convert Yaw (theta) to Quaternion
        # z = sin(theta/2), w = cos(theta/2)


        # TODO: Set Covariance (required by AMCL, small uncertainty such as [0.1]*36)
        

        # Call the service asynchronously
        future = self.reset_pose_client.call_async(request)

        # Add a callback to handle the service response
        future.add_done_callback(self.reset_pose_done_callback)
    ```

1. **Handle Service Response:** Add the following method to the `Gamepad` class:
    ```python
    def reset_pose_done_callback(self, future):
        """
        Callback function to handle the response from the 'reset_pose' service.
        """
        try:
            # Check if the service call was successful
            response = future.result()
            if response:
                self.get_logger().info("Pose reset successfully.")
            else:
                self.get_logger().error("Pose reset failed.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.get_logger().error(f"Service call failed: {e}")
    ```

### **Implement Coordinate Transformation**

1. **Modify the `imu_callback` Method** First, update the `imu_callback` method in the `MoveToGoal` class as follows:

   ```python
   def imu_callback(self, imu_msg: Imu) -> None:
       """
       Callback function for handling control relinquishment messages.
       Updates local yaw relative to the starting orientation.
       """
       q = imu_msg.orientation
       _, _, global_yaw = euler_from_quaternion([q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w])

       if self.initial_global_yaw is None:
           # Store the initial yaw as a reference
           self.initial_global_yaw = global_yaw
           return  # Skip first iteration

       # TODO: Compute local yaw relative to the initial global yaw
       self.local_yaw = 0
   ```

2. **Modify the `odom_callback` Method** Update the `odom_callback` method to handle odometry messages and update the local x and y coordinates relative to the starting position:

   ```python
   def odom_callback(self, msg: Odometry) -> None:
       """
       Callback function for handling odometry messages.
       Updates the local x and y coordinates relative to the starting position.
       """
       # Extract global x and y coordinates from the odometry message
       global_x = msg.pose.pose.position.x
       global_y = msg.pose.pose.position.y

       # Check if this is the first iteration (initial global position not set)
       if self.initial_global_x is None:
           # Store the initial global position as the reference point
           self.initial_global_x = global_x
           self.initial_global_y = global_y
           # Skip processing for the first iteration
           return

       # TODO: Compute the displacement of the global position from the initial global position
       dx = 0
       dy = 0

       # TODO: Rotate displacement to align with the initial local frame
       # This step is necessary to ensure the local coordinates are relative to the starting orientation
       self.local_x = 0
       self.local_y = 0
   ```

3. **Update the `control_loop` Method** Finally, ensure that the `control_loop` method is updated to reflect the changes in the coordinate transformation.


### **Build and Test the Package**

Let's ensure your package is built and tested properly:

1. **Build the `lab7_tf` Package**  Use the following command to build your package:
   ```bash
   $ ccbuild --packages-select lab7_tf
   ```

2. **Demo the Robot**
   - Run the `move2goal_tf` node to demonstrate the robot moving to the goal location `(-0.61, 0.61)` in meters and rotate the robot to face `0Â°`.
   - Press Button Y to reset the pose and redo the previous task.
