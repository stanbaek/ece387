## 📜 Overview
In real-world robotics, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is essential for tracking motion by measuring orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. The [ICM-20648 6-Axis MEMS MotionTracking Device](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-20648/) from TDK integrates a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor (DMP). This IMU is embedded in the OpenCR1.0 board, an open-source robot controller featuring an ARM Cortex-M7 processor. The OpenCR board applies an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse sensor data, generating IMU estimates at 170 Hz.

The IMU significantly enhances navigation accuracy when combined with odometry. It helps estimate the robot's position over time and improves localization.

As we discussed earlier, multiple sensors work together to estimate the TurtleBot3's attitude and heading. These sensors are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which can vary depending on the location and the device. Even everyday electronic components, including those on the OpenCR board, generate small magnetic fields. Although the IMU is placed at the center of the robot for optimal performance, it is still exposed to various magnetic interferences.

Fortunately, the TurtleBot3 developers anticipated this issue. Each time you run the serial node to connect to the robot, the IMU automatically calibrates itself, ensuring more accurate readings.


## 🌱 Pre-Lab: Testing the IMU  

### Step 1: Launch the TurtleBot3 Simulation

1. Open a terminal and start the TurtleBot3 simulation in Gazebo:
   ```bash
   $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Communication with the Master

1. Ensure the TurtleBot3 is properly communicating with the Master by listing active topics:
   ```bash
   $ ros2 topic list
   ```
1. You should see the following topics, including `/imu` and `/odom`:
   ```bash
   /battery_state
   /cmd_vel
   /imu
   /joint_states
   /magnetic_field
   /odom   
   /tf_static
    ```

### Step 3: Examine the `/imu` and `/odom` Topics
1. Run the `gamepad` and `joy` nodes.
1. Observe the IMU and odometry messages while moving the robot:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 topic echo /imu
    $ ros2 topic echo /odom
    ```
    Pay close attention to the `pose` field. In future labs, be mindful not to confuse the different pose hierarchies within the Imu and Odom messages.


### Step 4: Visualizing Data in `rqt`
1. Open `rqt`:
    ```bash
    $ rqt
    ```
1. Monitor `/imu` and `/odom` data in `rqt` while moving the robot.
1. Compare the pose data from Gazebo and `rqt`, noting how simulation noise affects readings.
1. Monitor the `/imu` and `/odom` topics using `rqt` as you move the robot in Gazebo.
1. In Gazebo, go to `Models` > `burger`, then in the `property` section, select `pose` to view the robot's position and orientation in roll-pitch-yaw format.
1. In `rqt`, enable the `Topic Monitor` and activate the `/imu` and `/odom` topics to track orientation and position in real time.
1. Note that orientation in `rqt` is shown using quaternions.
1. The pose values in Gazebo and rqt are not the same. Gazebo simulation publishes position and orientation with noise. By default, Gazebo adds Gaussian noise to the data generated by its sensors to simulate real-world conditions.




<!-- ### Setting up Team Repository.

1. Go to [Create a Team Repository within GitHub Classroom](TeamRepo) to setup a new GitHub repository for your team. 
2. Move the `Lab4_gamepad` directory from the `ece387_lastname` directory to `ece387_ws`. You no longer need the old code. Push all the code in the `ece387_lastname` directory to your GitHub repository as a backup and delete the `ece387_lastname` directory.  
3. Navigate to your ROS2 workspace, `~/master_ws` and remove the old files by running
   ```bash
   $ rm -rf install/ build/ log/
   ```
4. Ensure you still have the `turtlebot3_simulations` and `ece387_ws` directories within the `src` directory.
5. Rebuild the local packages
   ```bash
   $ colcon build --symlink-1nstall
   ```
 -->

   
## 💻 Lab Procedure

In this lab, you will create a ROS2 Python package that enables the TurtleBot3 to navigate to a desired **location and orientation** using data from the **IMU (`/imu`)** and **ODOM (`/odom`)** topics.

### 🛠 Update `.bashrc` for Easier Builds

To avoid common mistakes when running `colcon build`, follow these steps to streamline your workflow. This will ensure that `colcon build` is always run in the correct directory and that the necessary setup file is sourced automatically.

1. Use `gedit` to open the `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   $ gedit ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. At the end of the file, add the following function:
   ```bash
   # Function to build with optional arguments
   function ccbuild() {
       cd ~/master_ws && colcon build --symlink-install "$@"
       source ~/master_ws/install/setup.bash
   }

   # Export the function to make it available in the shell
   export -f ccbuild
   ```

1. Save the file, exit the editor, and restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

1. Instead of manually navigating to `~/master_ws`, running `colcon build --symlink-install`, and sourcing `install/setup.bash`, you can now simply run:
   ```bash
   $ ccbuild
   ```
   This ensures the build process is executed correctly every time and and sources the necessary setup file.

1. You can also pass arguments to `colcon build` through the `ccbuild` function. For example:
   ```bash
   $ ccbuild --packages-select lab6_nav
   ```
    This builds only the `lab6_nav` package, saving time by skipping previously built packages.

1. By following these steps, you'll streamline your workflow and minimize build-related errors.

### 🛠 Testing IMU on the Physical Robot

To test the IMU on the physical robot, follow these steps:

1. Use SSH to launch the `robot.launch.py` file on the robot.
1. Start the `gamepad` and `joy` nodes on your master computer.
1. As you move the robot in Gazebo, monitor the `/imu` and `/odom` topics using:
   ```bash
   $ ros2 topic echo /imu
   ```
   ```bash
   $ ros2 topic echo /odom
   ```
1. The raw output of these topics can be overwhelming. Use the following commands to filter and display only the relevant sections:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /imu | grep -A 4 'orientation'
   ```
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /odom | grep -A 3 'position'
   ```
   - The `-A` option in `grep` stands for "after context." It displays the specified number of lines following the matching line.
   - For `/imu`, this command shows the `orientation` section and the next 4 lines.
   - For `/odom`, it shows the `position` section and the next 3 lines.

1. **Convert quaternions to Euler angles:** Both topics use quaternions to represent orientation, which are not human-readable. Later, we will convert these quaternions into Euler angles for easier interpretation.


### 🛠 Modify `gamepad.py` to Include Control Relinquishment

In this section, you'll modify the `gamepad.py` script to add functionality for relinquishing and regaining control of the robot. This will allow users to toggle control states using specific gamepad buttons.

1. Locate and open the `gamepad.py` file.
1. In the constructor of the `Gamepad` class, add the following attributes:
   ```python
   # Flag to track control status (default: True)
   self.has_control = True

   # Create a publisher for control relinquishment messages.
   # - Publishes to the 'ctrl_relinq' topic.
   # - Uses Bool messages to indicate control status.
   # - Queue size of 1 ensures only the latest control state is kept.
   self.ctrl_pub = self.create_publisher(Bool, 'ctrl_relinq', 1)
   ```

1. In the `joy_callback` method, implement the following logic to toggle control using buttons A (Green) and B (Red):
   ```python
   # Create a new Bool message for "control relinquishment status"
   relinquish = Bool()

   # TODO: Check if the RC (Remote Control) has control and button A (Green) is pressed
       # Set control flag to False (relinquish control)
       # Change "control status" to relinquished.
       # Publish the control status
       
       # Log status update
       self.get_logger().info("RC has relinquished control.")  

   # TODO: Check if RC does not have control and button B (Red) is pressed
       # Set control flag to True (regain control)
       # Set control status to regained.
       # Publish the control status
       
       # Log status update
       self.get_logger().info("RC has taken over control.")  

   # If control is relinquished, stop further processing
   if not self.has_control:
       return
   ```
   
   This is a common safety practice in robotics to halt autonomous tasks a robot is executing.  Another safety practice is to integrating an easily accessible emergency stop switch that cuts off the main power to the robot.  


1. Test the gamepad node:
   - Run the gamepad node.
   - Open another terminal and monitor the `cmd_vel` topic.
   - Press **button A** on the gamepad and verify that control is relinquished (no movement commands should be published by the gamepad).
   - Press **button B** and verify that control is regained (movement commands should be published again).
   - Check the `ctrl_relinq` topic to confirm that control status messages are being published.


### **Create a New ROS2 Package**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src` directory of your workspace:
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/master_ws/src/ece387_ws
   ```

1. Use the following command to create a new ROS2 package named `lab6_nav`:
   ```bash
   $ ros2 pkg create lab6_nav --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy geometry_msgs nav_msgs sensor_msgs
   ```
   - **Dependencies:**
     - `rclpy`: ROS2 Python API.
     - `geometry_msgs`: For `Twist` messages (velocity commands).
     - `nav_msgs`: For `Odometry` messages.
     - `sensor_msgs`: For `IMU` messages.

1. Download the [`move2goal.py`](../files/move2goal.py) file and save it in the `lab6_nav` package directory:
   ```
   ~/master_ws/src/ece387_ws/lab6_nav/lab6_nav/
   ```

1. Open the `setup.py` file and modify the `entry_points` section to include the `move2goal` script:
   ```python
   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'move2goal = lab6_nav.move2goal:main',
       ],
   },
   ```

1. Build the package using the `ccbuild` command:
   ```bash
   ccbuild
   ```

### **Implement the `move2goal.py` Script**

The `move2goal.py` script will control the TurtleBot3 to move to a specified goal location and orientation. Follow these steps to complete the implementation:

1. Initialize publishers and subscribers.
    - **Publisher:** Create a publisher for `/cmd_vel` to send velocity commands to the robot.
    - **Subscribers:** Subscribe to:
        - `/odom` to track the robot's position.
        - `/imu` to get orientation data.
        - `/ctrl_relinq` to check if the node has control.

1. Implement the `odom_callback` function
    - Extract the `x` and `y` position from the received `Odometry` message.

1. Implement the `imu_callback` function
    - Extract the quaternion orientation from the `Imu` message.
    - Convert the quaternion to Euler angles using the `euler_from_quaternion` function.
    - Update the `yaw` value.

1. Implement the `ctrl_relinq_callback` function
    - Update the `self.has_control` flag based on the received `Bool` message.
    - Log a message indicating whether control is taken or relinquished.

1. Implement the `control_loop` function
    - Compute the **angle to the goal** and normalize it to the range [-$\pi$, $\pi$].
    - Compute the **distance to the goal** using the Euclidean distance formula.

1. Complete the state machine logic: The state machine consists of four states:

    - **ROTATE_TO_GOAL:**
        - If the angle error is greater than `0.05` radians, rotate the robot with an angular speed proportional to the error (`0.3 * angle_error`). Adjust the proportional coefficient as needed.
        - If the angle error is within the threshold, transition to `MOVE_FORWARD`.

    - **MOVE_FORWARD:**
        - Move the robot forward at a constant speed of `0.15` (adjustable, but the robot's maximum speed is `0.22`).
        - If the distance to the goal is less than `0.15`, transition to `ROTATE_TO_FINAL`.

    - **ROTATE_TO_FINAL:**
        - Compute the final orientation error and normalize it.
        - If the error is greater than `0.05` radians, rotate the robot with a speed proportional to the error (`0.5 * final_angle_error`).
        - If the error is within the threshold, transition to `GOAL_REACHED`.

    - **GOAL_REACHED:**
        - Log a message confirming the goal has been reached.
        - Stop publishing movement commands.

1. Publish velocity commands: Ensure `cmd_vel` messages are published correctly in each state of the state machine.


### **Build and Test the Package**

1. Install `tf-transformations` using
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations
   ```

1. Build the `lab6_nav` package using:
   ```bash
   $ ccbuild --packages-select lab6_nav
   ```

1. Demo the robot:
   - Run the `move2goal` node and demonstrate the robot moving to the goal location `(-0.61, 0.61)` in meters.
   - Rotate the robot to face `0°`.
   - **Hint:** Most floor and ceiling tiles in the U.S. are 1' by 1' or 2' by 2'. Use this to estimate distances. (1 foot = 30.48 cm).

### 🚚 Deliverables

1. **[15 Points] Complete the `move2goal.py` Script:**
    - Ensure the script is fully functional and implements all required features.
    - Push your code to GitHub and confirm that it has been successfully uploaded. **NOTE:** _If the instructor can't find your code in your repository, you will receive a grade of 0 for the coding part._

1. **[15 Points] Demonstration:**
   - Show the robot successfully navigating to the goal location and orientation in a real-world setup.

1. **[20 Points] Performance Analysis:**
    - Examine the distance and angle errors printed by `move2goal.py`.
    - Discuss the robot's performance:
        - Can the robot navigate to a farther distance, such as `(-3, 3)`? Why or why not?
        - After the robot reaches the goal, restart the demo without rebooting the robot. Does it work as before? If not, why doesn't it work anymore?
        - Suggest improvements to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities.
    - Note 1: This deliverable is worth 20 points, more than the other deliverables. Therefore, a detailed and rigorous analysis is expected. Treat this as the analysis section of your project report.
    - Note 2: Provide quantitative analysis, not qualitative. You don't need to include plots of measured data, but you should provide the measured data for your analysis. For example, instead of saying, "The robot's orientation drifted quite a bit as it traveled almost one meter," you should say, "With its initial orientation of 43.5$^\circ$, the robot gradually drifted to 39.3$^\circ$ after traveling 0.73 meters." For your project, you will need to provide plots for the measured data.
