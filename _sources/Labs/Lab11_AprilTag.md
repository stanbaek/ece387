## 📜 Overview

This lab introduces the use of **fiducial markers**—specifically **AprilTags**—for robot perception and navigation. These markers are used in robotics for tasks like localization, mapping, and interaction with known objects. AprilTags are square, black-and-white markers that encode an ID in a unique pattern, allowing them to be recognized by a vision system.

We'll use **ROS2** tools and a camera to detect AprilTags in the environment. The camera will provide images to a detection node, which will process these images and estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of each tag relative to the camera. With this information, we can calculate the robot's distance from the tag and understand its spatial relationship to the object.

Before detecting tags, we must first calibrate the USB camera to correct for lens distortion and establish a reliable relationship between image pixels and real-world measurements. Calibration ensures accurate position and distance calculations.

This lab will also help solidify your understanding of ROS2 topics, nodes, and message types—all critical for real-world robotic applications.

## 🛠️ Lab Procedures

### ✅ Part 1: Calibrate the USB Camera

For a camera to effectively perform computer vision tasks, it must first be calibrated. Without calibration, there's no reliable reference for determining the size of objects within the camera's frame. The [ROS Calibration Tool](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration) generates a calibration file that other ROS packages can use to calculate object size and distance. The **camera_calibration** package leverages OpenCV's calibration techniques to simplify the process of calibrating monocular or stereo cameras, typically using a checkerboard pattern as the target. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Camera Calibration Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration).

1. Disconnect the camera from the robot and plug it into the **Master computer**. Then run:

    ```bash
    ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p video_device:=/dev/video0
    ```

1. Check if topics are being published:
    ```bash
    ros2 topic list
    ```

    Make sure you see `/image_raw` and `/camera_info`. Then check the message type:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic type /camera_info
    ros2 interface show <message>
    ```

1. Echo the camera info:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic echo /camera_info
    ```

    Look for values under `K`, `R`, and `P`. Initially, they’ll be all zeros—this means the camera is not yet calibrated.

    > 💡 You should be comfortable using these ROS2 commands. Expect to answer related questions during graded reviews (GRs).

1. Run the calibration tool. Use the checkerboard (9x6 internal corners, 2.5 cm spacing). Run:
    ```bash
    ros2 run camera_calibration cameracalibrator --size 9x6 --square 0.025 --camera_name default_cam --no-service-check --ros-args -r image:=/image_raw
    ```
    This launches a calibration window.

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab11_Calibration.png
    :width: 500  
    :align: center  
    ```  

1. To collect calibration data, move the checkerboard in the camera view in various ways:
    - Left/right/top/bottom
    - Closer/farther
    - Tilted at angles
    - Fill the entire frame

    Four progress bars will fill up. When the "CALIBRATE" button activates, click it.

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab11_Calibrate.png
    :width: 500  
    :align: center  
    ```  

    > 🕓 Calibration may take a few minutes. The windows might be greyed out but just wait, it is working.

    When complete, it will display something similar to the following output:

    ```bash

1. Save and extract calibration data. Click **Save**, then **Commit**. Browse to the location of the calibration data and extract
    ```bash
    cd /tmp
    tar xf calibrationdata.tar.gz
    ```

    Move the `ost.yaml` file to the correct ROS folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/.ros
    mkdir camera_info
    mv /tmp/ost.yaml ./camera_info/default_cam.yaml
    ```

1. Relaunch the camera node:

    ```bash
    ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p video_device:=/dev/video0
    ```

1. Take another look at the `camera_info` topic. Do you notice any differences compared to the message published by the `usb_cam` node when calibration data is not included? Keep in mind that the `usb_cam` node does not use the `CameraInfo` message to produce rectified images from the raw data (`\image_raw`). Instead, it publishes the `CameraInfo` message so that you can use it to create rectified images if needed.

1. Take a screenshot of the calibrated `camera_info` output. This is one of your deliverables.

### ✅ Part 2: AprilTag Detection with ROS2

In this section, you will explore how to detect AprilTags in ROS 2. There are several methods to achieve this, one of which involves using multiple existing ROS nodes and connecting them via ROS topics. While this approach may seem straightforward, managing the interactions between different nodes can become complex and inefficient. To simplify this process, we will develop our own custom node to handle all the required functionality.

1. Create a package named `lab11_apriltag` with the dependencies:
- `rclpy`
- `cv_bridge`
- `sensor_msgs`
- `std_msgs`
- `opencv2`

1. Download the provided [`apriltag.py`](../files/apriltag.py) and place it in your package’s scripts directory.

1. Update your `setup.py` to include the script as an entry point. This is necessary to ensure that the script runs as a node.

1. Inside your package (not the scripts folder), create a new directory called `config`. Next, copy the `default_cam.yaml` file into this directory. The code in `apriltag.py` is already set up to load this default calibration file if no calibration file path is provided by the user when the node is executed. Your directory structure should look like this:

    ```bash
    lab11_apriltag/
    ├── config/
    │   └── default_cam.yaml
    ├── lab11_apriltag/
    ├── resources/
    └── ...
    ```

1. Add this path to your `setup.py` under `data_files`:

    ```python
    data_files=[
        ('share/' + package_name + '/config', ['config/default_cam.yaml']),
        ...
    ]
    ```
    And in `package.xml`, include:
    ```xml
    <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
    <exec_depend>ament_index_python</exec_depend>
    ```

1. Open the `apriltag.py` script and examine the constructor to understand how it handles loading files via command line arguments. If no argument is provided, it defaults to a pre-configured file. Pay close attention to the `load_camera_info` method—it demonstrates how to extract data from a `yaml` file effectively. While the same functionality could be achieved by subscribing to the `camera_info` topic published by the `usb_cam` node, using a calibration file is more efficient since the `camera_info` topic repeatedly publishes identical data over time.

2. Launch the `usb_cam` node with a frame rate set to **15 Hz**:
   ```bash
   ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p vidoe_device:=/dev/video0 -p framerate:=15.0
   ```

3. Start the `apriltag_ros` node to detect AprilTags.
    `bash
    ros2 run lab11_apriltag apriltag_node --ros-args -p cammera_info_file:=~/.ros/camera_info/default_cam.yam1
    ```

4. Open another terminal and echo the topic `/apriltag_pose` on the master. Observe the output. Does the `apriltag_ros` node detect more than one tag simultaneously? Consider which value might be used to calculate the distance to a tag, and note the type of message being published. Identify the package this message originates from.

5. Demonstrate to the instructor that the **apriltag_ros** node is successfully detecting tags and publishing their position data.

With a properly calibrated camera, you are now equipped to identify AprilTags along with their size, orientation, and distance.


### ✅ Part 3: Launch

This section guides you through creating a launch file to run three key nodes: `usb_cam`, `stop_detector`, and `apriltag_node`, with the required parameters.

1. Revisit the `gamepad.launch.py` file from Lab 8 ([Using ROS2 Launch Files](Lidar:Launch)). This section provides only an overview, so ensure you thoroughly refresh your understanding of the launch file creation process before proceeding.

2. Locate the `stop_detector.svm` file from Lab 10 and copy it to the `config` directory within the `lab11_apriltag` package. Then, update the `setup.py` script by adding `stop_detector.svm` to the `data_files` section. This step ensures the file is appropriately packaged and accessible.

3. Download the provided [`vision.launch.py`](../files/vision.launch.py) and place it in the launch directory of the `lab11_apriltag` package.  
   - Edit this file as you did in Lab 8, ensuring you include all three nodes: `usb_cam`, `stop_detector`, and `apriltag_node`.
    - Ensure the necessary import statements and configuration setup: 
        ```python
        from launch import LaunchDescription
        from launch_ros.actions import Node
        from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
        import os
        ```
   - Make sure the paths to important configuration files are correctly configured.
        ```python
        pkg_share = get_package_share_directory('lab11_apriltag')
        config_dir = os.path.join(pkg_share, 'config')

        stop_detector_model = os.path.join(config_dir, 'stop_detector.svm')
        camera_info_path = os.path.join(config_dir, 'default_cam.yaml')
        camera_info_url = 'file://' + camera_info_path
        ```

    - Ensure the nodes are properly configured with the required parameters. Use paths to the configuration files to make your launch file robust and dynamic.  

    ```{important}
    **Do not copy code snippets verbatim without understanding their functionality.** You will be required to answer related questions during GRs or assessments, so ensure your comprehension of each step and its purpose.
    ```

1. Add the launch file (`vision.launch.py`) to the `data_files` section in the `setup.py` script. This inclusion ensures the launch file is packaged correctly.

1. Build and Test  
   - Build your package to compile any changes made.  
   - Execute the `vision.launch.py` file. Verify that the nodes (`usb_cam`, `stop_detector`, and `apriltag_node`) launch successfully.  
   - Confirm detection functionality by observing the published topics and verifying that both stop signs and AprilTags are detected accurately.
