## üìå Objectives

- Students should be able to


## Lesson Objectives:
1. Gain additional familiarity with simulation environment
1. Gain familiarity with Turtlebot 3 robotics platform
1. Practice with ROS diagnostic tools

## Agenda:
1. Use Linux terminals to launch and control Turtlebot 3 in simulation environment.
1. Use Linux terminals to launch and control actual Turtlebot 3.




## üìú Overview
This lab will introduce you to utilizing pre-built ROS packages to accomplish a task. It will also provide you experience interacting with someone else's source code (.py files) to learn how that component works. You will use ROS to run two nodes, **turtlebot3_core** and **teleop_twist_keyboard**, to drive the Turtlebot3 with a keyboard. You will continue to practice using ROS tools to observe how these components communicate.



## üíª Lab Procedure

### Working with a Remote Machine

In this course, you'll drive your TurtleBot without the need for a monitor and keyboard. However, you'll still need access to the Raspberry Pi on the robot to run ROS nodes. One of the easiest ways to remotely access a Linux machine is through a secure shell (SSH). To create an SSH connection, you'll need the username and hostname (or IP address) of the computer you want to access. For the Raspberry Pis, the username is `pi` and the hostname is your robot number (e.g., `robot98`).

(AccessPoint)=
1. **Connect to the Robot's Wi-Fi Network**:
    - Click the system menu in the top-right corner to open the Wi-Fi Networks setting.
    - Choose `RobotXX`, where `XX` corresponds to the `XX` in `MasterXX`.

    <br>

1. **Check Connectivity**:
    - The Raspberry Pi on your robot acts as a Wi-Fi access point (AP), allowing communication with your master computer.
    - Open a terminal on your master computer.
    - Check connectivity to the robot using its IP address, `192.168.4.1`:
      ```sh
      $ ping 192.168.4.1
      ```

1. **Create a Secure Shell Connection**: To access the robot remotely, create an SSH connection:
      ```sh
      $ ssh pi@192.168.4.1
      ```
      > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `ssh <username>@<hostname/IP address>`

1. **Enter the Robot's Password**: After entering the robot's password, the terminal should display the `pi` username and your robot's hostname, `robotX`. Any commands you run in this shell will execute on the robot.

1. **Change Your Password**: 
    - Once logged in, type the following command:
        ```bash
        $ passwd
        ```
    - You will be prompted to enter your **current password**. Type it and press **Enter**.
    - Next, you will be asked to enter a **new password**. Type a password and press **Enter**.
    - Retype the **new password** to confirm and press **Enter**.  If successful, you will see the message:
        ```
        password updated successfully
        ```

    - To ensure that your new password works, you can open a new terminal and try logging in again:
        ```bash
        $ ssh pi@192.168.4.1
        ```
        Enter the **new password** when prompted.

1. **Edit the `.bashrc` File**:
    - Open the `.bashrc` file by running the following command:
        ```sh
        $ nano ~/.bashrc
        ```   
   - You should see the following lines at the bottom of the `.bashrc` file:
      ```bash
      source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
      source ~/robot_ws/install/setup.bash
      source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh
      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0  # For master0 and robot0
      export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/humble/
      export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
      export LDS_MODEL=LDS-01  # Replace with LDS-02 if using new LIDAR
      source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
      ```
    - Your `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=XX` should match your computer ID, where `XX` corresponds to the `XX` in `MasterXX`.
    - The robots for our class have two different LIDAR variants: LDS-01 and LDS-02 (pictured below).
        ```{image} ./figures/Lab5_LDS.png
        :width: 480
        :align: center
        ```
        <br>
    - If you have the LDS-02, update `export LDS_MODEL=LDS-01` to `export LDS_MODEL=LDS-02` inside the `.bashrc` file.
    - Save the changes and exit the editor.
    
1. **Close the SSH Connection**: You can type `exit` to close the SSH connection.


### Updating the Hosts File on Master

As it is much easier to remember and use the host name than the IP address, let's modify the `hosts` file so that the master computer recognizes the host name of the Raspberry Pi.

```{warning}
Ensure that you execute the commands in this section on the **Master** computer. Do not execute them on the Raspberry Pi.
```

1. **Update the Hosts File on Master**: To add the robot's IP address to the hosts file, follow these steps on the **`Master`** computer:
    ```sh
    $ sudo gedit /etc/hosts
    ```
    Add the following line to the file:
    ```sh
    192.168.4.1    robotXX
    ```
    Replace `robotXX` with your specific robot number.

1. **Save and Close the Hosts File**: Save the changes and close the file by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to exit.

1. **Check Connectivity**: Check connectivity to the robot using its host name, `robotXX`:
    ```sh
    $ ping robotXX
    ```

1. **Create a Secure Shell Connection**: To access the robot remotely, create an SSH connection:
    ```sh
    $ ssh pi@robotXX
    ```
    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `ssh <username>@<hostname>`

1. **Enter the Robot's Password**: After entering the robot's password, the terminal should display the `pi` username and your robot's hostname, `robotXX`. 


### Setting Up Password-Free SSH Using RSA Keys

Using password-free SSH authentication improves both security and convenience. Instead of manually entering a password each time, SSH keys provide a more secure and automated way to log in. This also makes remote access faster and more efficient.

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair on the Client**: Open a terminal on the client machine and run the following command to generate an RSA key pair:
    ```bash
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```
    When prompted to enter a file to save the key, press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).  If prompted for a passphrase, leave it **empty** (just press Enter) to enable password-free login.


1. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server**: You need to transfer your public key to the server. Run the following command, replacing `username` and `hostname` with your actual credentials:
    ```bash
    $ ssh-copy-id username@hostname
    ```
    If prompted, enter your password for the remote machine. After this, the key will be added to the server's authorized keys.

1. **Test the Connection**: Now, try logging into the remote machine without a password:
    ```bash
    $ ssh username@hostname
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should log in without being prompted for a password.


### Driving the Robot

1. Using the secure shell, run the **turtlebot3_core.launch** file on the robot.     **Note:** The following command has a typo. Use the `tab` key to autocomplete the command.

    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch
    ```
    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `ros2 launch <package> <launchfile>`

    It will print something similar to:
    ```bash
    [turtlebot3_ros-3] [INFO] [1738299487.825470539] [turtlebot3_node]: Succeeded to create battery state publisher
    [turtlebot3_ros-3] [INFO] [1738299487.829476168] [turtlebot3_node]: Succeeded to create imu publisher

    [turtlebot3_ros-3] [INFO] [1738299487.909780816] [diff_drive_controller]: Run!
    ```
 
    We will learn more about launch files in a few modules, but just understand that a launch file is used to launch one or more ROS nodes. 
    
    Your Turtlebot3 is now ready to drive and should be listening for *Twist* messages to be sent over the **/cmd_vel** topic.


1. It is always a good idea to check that the Turtlebot3 is communicating with the Master. To do this, we can list the active topics the Turtlebot3 is publishing. Run the following within your **Master**:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 topic list
    ```
    
    If all is well, it should display something similar to 
    ```bash
    /battery_state
    /cmd_vel
    /imu
    /joint_states
    /magnetic_field
    /odom
    /parameter_events
    /robot_description
    /rosout
    /sensor_state
    /tf
    /tf_static
    ```

1. Open a new terminal on the Master and observe the nodes currently running:
    ```bash
    $ rqt_graph`
    ```
    You should see `/turtlebot3_node` subscribing to the `\cmd_vel` topic and publishing multiple topics including `\imu`. 
    
1. Open a new terminal and run 
    ```bash
    $ ros2 node info /turtlebot3_node
    ```
    You should be able to find the topics `/turtlebot3_node` is publishing and subscribing to.

    
1. We used the **/cmd_vel** topic when driving the simulated Turtlebot3, but let's refresh our memory about the topic:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 topic info /cmd_vel`
    ```

    We can find that topic utilizes the *Twist* message type. We can also verify this by
    ```bash
    $ ros2 topic type /cmd_vel
    ```
    
    The following will show information about the fields within the *Twist* message sent over the **/cmd_vel** topic:
    **Note:** The following command has a typo. Use the `tab` key for autocompletion.
    ```bash
    $ ros2 interface show geometry_msg/msg/Twist
    ```

    
1. Run the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node on the Master:

    ```{tip}
    Don't forget your tab completion! You can start typing a package name or node and then hit tab for it to complete the command for you!
    ```
    
    `ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard`
    
1. Before we get too excited and drive the Turtlebot3 off a cliff, observe how the nodes communicate using the **rqt_graph** tool in a new terminal (if you still have the previous rqt_graph running, you can hit the refresh button in the top left corner).

1. Select the terminal that has the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node running and observe the instructions for sending `Twist` messages. These are the same as when driving the simulated Turtlebot3.

1. The Turtlebot3 operates best with a linear velocity between 0.2 m/s and 0.5 m/s. It turns best with an angular velocity between 0.5 rad/s and 1.5 rad/s. Drive the TurtleBot3 using these parameters.

## ROS

In labs throughout this course we will request information about the topics, nodes, and messages within your system. Accomplish the following in a new terminal on your Master (you can ignore all nodes/topics that result from **roscore**).

1. List all running nodes.

1. Determine what topics the nodes subscribe and publish to (repeat for each node).

1. Display running nodes and communication between them.

1. List the active topics.

1. Determine the type of messages sent over the topics (repeat for each topic).

1. Determine the fields of the messages.

1. Observe the information sent over a topic (repeat for each topic).

## Checkpoint
Once complete, push screenshots showing the output of each of the above to your student repo on github in a /master/module04 folder.

## Summary
In this exercise you examined and used pre-built packages and source code to drive the Turtlebot3 and understand how the system worked. You then were able to analyze the topics, nodes, and messages within the ROS system to better understand the flow of information and control. The **pro-tips** presented throughout this exercise will make you a better user of Linux and ROS.


```{tip} 
I strongly recommend that you commit the above sequence of commands to memory, or at a minimum
have them in a place that you can quickly recall them. There is nothing until Module 9 that absolutely requires the real robot, as everything else can be simulated.
