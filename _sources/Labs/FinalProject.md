# 🚀 Final Project

```{attention}
Read this page thoroughly before you start working on this final project.   
```

## 📌 Objectives  

- Students will integrate concepts from earlier modules to design and implement a complete robotic system capable of handling complex tasks using ROS2.  
- Students will demonstrate proficiency in robotic systems by building task-specific machines with onboard computing.  
- Students will apply knowledge from across the course to develop, test, and deliver a functional final project.

## 📜 Overview  

In this final project, you'll combine everything you've learned throughout the course to design and implement a complete robotic system using ROS2. The project challenges you to create a robot that solves real-world tasks, requiring multiple components to work together seamlessly.  

Your robot will navigate a maze in the lab, employing technologies from previous modules:  

- **LIDAR:** Keeps the robot centered between walls.  
- **IMU:** Handles precise turns (90°, -90°, 270°).  
- **OpenCV:** Detects and reacts to stop signs.  
- **AprilTags:** Guides the robot through the maze using tag IDs and distances to decide actions like turning or stopping at specific locations.  

```{important}
If you notice any discrepancies in the project description or grading criteria, the correct information will follow this order of priority: (1) Instructor messages via Teams, (2) this Course Web, (3) Gradescope, and (4) the project overview slides. The Course Web will always be updated immediately to reflect any changes, and outdated instructions will be clearly crossed out.
```

## 🏴‍☠️ Story  

Ahoy, crew!  The legendary 💀 pirate captain, Stan Baek, has uncovered an ancient scroll that reveals the location of a hidden treasure island. But there's a catch—the treasure is locked deep inside a deadly maze!

According to the scroll, the maze is marked with enigmatic symbols known as AprilTags. These cryptic signs hold the key to locating the treasure. Miss one, or read it wrong, and... well, let's just say you won't be making it back.

Rather than braving the perilous maze, the infamous pirate captain, Dr. Baek, is relying on you to develop cutting-edge technology to solve the mystery. Your task is to design and build a robotic system that can navigate the maze independently, decode the AprilTags, and uncover the treasure's hidden location.

Here's what the scroll reveals about navigating the maze:  

1. **Follow the walls in the maze at all times.**  
2. **Avoid stopping at or looking out windows - those are deadly!**  
3. **React to AprilTags:** These tags act like arrows you must follow. Detect the AprilTag and follow the direction indicated.  
   - If the tag's yaw is $90^\circ$, make a $90^\circ$ **left** turn (counterclockwise). Note that the yaw angle is measured relative to the camera frame, not the AprilTag itself.
   - **Tag ID 0 & 1:** Follow the direction shown on the tag.  
   - **Tag ID 2:** Follow the direction, but the scroll warns that the treasure chest is nearby. Look around to locate the treasure chest, which is buried under **AprilTag ID 4**. Record the pose (position and orientation) of the treasure chest; you will need to report this once the robot returns home.  
   - **Tag ID 3:** The scroll says this is a trap. Stop for at least 5 seconds, then make the turn shown on the tag — but in the **opposite** direction. For example, if the tag indicates a $90^\circ$ turn, you must instead make a $-270^\circ$ clockwise turn.  
4. **Stop Sign:** You have reached the exit of the maze. Stop within 0.6 meters of the sign. Report (print to the terminal) the location and orientation of the treasure chest.

Once you locate the treasure chest, send Captain Baek the maze map along with the chest's pose in the map so he can claim the loot!

## 🎮 Final Project Gamesmanship

### 1. Demo & Coding (40 points)  

- Review the presentation and final report requirements **before** you begin coding.  
- **Start early**—delays can put your completion at risk.  
- Use the code from Labs 10 and 11 as a reference, but **do not** implement your project within those lab files. Instructors will evaluate the code inside your `final_project` folder.  **You must name it final_project**.
- Take advantage of debugging tools like `rqt`, `ros2 topic`, and `rviz` to fine-tune high-level behaviors.  
- **Prioritize your final report:**  
  - Your analysis in the report is more important than completing the maze.  
  - Manage your time carefully—don't sacrifice report quality for extra demo points. Losing 10 points on the report to earn 5 points in the demo isn't worth it!  

### 2. Presentation (20 points)  

- **Make visuals a priority!** Figures, tables, and graphs often communicate concepts better than lengthy explanations.  
- **Cover all required details** in your presentation.  
- Stick to the **5-minute limit**—practice to refine your delivery. At the 6-minute mark, your talk will be stopped, and any content beyond that **won't** be graded. Time management is key, just as it is in professional conferences.  
- **Practice, practice, practice.** Short presentations that lack detail often result in lost points. Even experienced engineers practice for their conference presentations.
- Carefully review the **rubric** posted on Teams before you begin.

### 3. Final Report (40 points)  

- Strengthen your analysis with figures and tables to clearly present your findings.  
- If you opt for an in-person demo, **also** submit a video demo that aligns with your report's plots to support your documentation.

```

<br>

1. **Gamepad Control (2 points):**
    - Place your robot behind the brown line.
    - Use the gamepad to move your robot to the starting position (white box), then **relinquish control** so it can begin navigating the maze.
    - Use the brown marker inside the white box as the origin of the maze frame.
1. **Wall Following (10 points):**  
    - The robot must follow the maze walls without colliding.  
    - Each wall collision results in a **1-point deduction**.  
    - However, if the robot successfully reaches the final goal (yellow line), no more than **3 points** will be deducted.  
1. **Stop Sign (5 points):**  
    - The robot must stop at the **yellow line**, with its bottom plate covering any part of it.  
    - After coming to a complete stop, the robot must **print its current pose and the treasure chest's pose**, then remain stopped indefinitely.  
1. **AprilTags (20 points):**  
    - The robot must stop at the **orange line** before turning.  
    - Once the robot stops, you must print the tags' poses relative to the origin (the brown marker) on the screen.
    - Its bottom plate must cover at least part of the orange line before executing a turn.  
    - Precise turns aren't directly graded, but improving turn accuracy will **boost overall performance**.  
1. **Map Generation (5 points):**  
    - As the robot explores the maze, it must generate a **map**.  
    - This map should be included in your final report.
