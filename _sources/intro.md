## 📝 Course information
- **Course Goal**: Cadets shall design, implement, test, and debug robotics-based systems by developing Python programs incorporating built-in Robotics Operating System (ROS) functions and successfully interfacing the microcomputer with the external world. 

- **Course Text**: There is no printed textbook for ECE 387. Reading materials/labs are posted on this Course Web.
- **Syllabus**: Posted [here](syllabus.md).
- **Course Schedule**: Posted [here](schedule.md) and subject to change.

## 📡 Communication and Control (C2)
- All communication and announcement 📣 will be provided through MS Teams
- All lecture 📓 materials will be provided through MS Teams.
- Laboratory 🔬 work will be posted in this course web.
- All assignments must be submitted in [Gradescope](https://www.gradecope.com)
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com) will be used for students to provide their source code 📄 for homework and laboratory assignments.

## ⏰ Late Policy:  
**If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance**

- The cutoff for **on-time submission is 07:00 🕖 a.m.** on the due date. 
- Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting between 07:00:01 on the due date and 07:00:00 the next day is one day late, and so on.
- You are given **5 grace days (self-granted extensions)** which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. No more than **2 grace days** (calendar days) can used for each assignment.
- Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are used and only given in exceptional situations. Computer problems such as hard-drive reimaging are **not** considered as exceptional situations and you must use grace days.
- Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is 💥 **discounted up to 20% for the first day late and up to 15% per day late thereafter**.
- Every assignment has a hard deadline; **4 calendar days** past the original due date. 
- Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline or after the solution to the assignment is published. No late submissions (penalty or not) will be accepted for the assignments right before GRs.

## 📄 Documentation Requirements

- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation policy. 
- Each documentation statement must be specific enough that it explicitly describes what assistance was provided, how it was used in completing the assignment, and who provided the assistance.
- If no help was received on this assignment, the documentation statement must state “None.”
- If you checked answers with anyone, you must document with whom on which problems. You must document whether you made any changes or not.  If you did make changes, you must document the problems you changed and the reasons why.
- Vague documentation statements will result in a 5% deduction on the assignment.


## 🤝 Collaboration Policy:  

Unless  specifically directed otherwise, the collaboration policy for this course is:

Authorized resources: Any material from the ECE 382 course site and online sources regarding C programming syntax only. This does not include any solutions or solution stubs for challenges similar to those asked in any assignments. 

- For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.  We expect all graded work, including code and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person’s work, with or without documentation, will result in  **NO** academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.
- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation policy.
- GRs are individual efforts. No collaboration is allowed while taking these exams. All electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, etc.) must be placed out of sight for the duration of the event. If any electronic device is seen during the event, the student will receive a zero for that effort.
