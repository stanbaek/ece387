# Login Server Setup

This guide covers setting up the **login server** — the machine that hosts OpenLDAP (user accounts) and NFS (shared home directories) for the lab. It is one of three companion guides:

- **Login Server Setup** (this page) — the login server itself
- [Master (Client) Setup](login-client.md) — master computers that authenticate against the login server
- [Master Setup - Standalone](MasterSetupJazzy.md) — a single master with a local account, no login server

## Why a Login Server?

A login server (OpenLDAP + SSSD + NFS) is only worth the setup effort in one specific situation: **a shared lab of fixed, dedicated computers that many different students rotate through.**

**When a login server helps:**

- The lab has a bank of master computers (e.g., 14 NUCs) and students do not own or sit at the same machine every session.
- A student should be able to sit down at *any* master, log in with their own credentials, and immediately have their `.bashrc`, SSH keys, and ROS workspace available — without re-cloning or re-configuring anything.
- You want to manage 20–30 student accounts centrally: create them once, reset a forgotten password in one command, and push a `.bashrc` update to every account at once (see [Maintenance](#3-maintenance)). The shell environment is instructor-owned — every account runs an identical, known-good `.bashrc`, so "it works on my machine" never enters a debugging session.
- You need some isolation between students who share the same physical hardware (restricted sudo, separate home directories, no ability to read another student's files).

**When a login server is overkill:**

- Students each have their own laptop or a personal workstation they always use. In that case there is nothing to "roam" between — a local Ubuntu account already gives each student a persistent home directory, and centralized authentication just adds an extra server to install, patch, and keep running (plus a single point of failure if it goes down). Use [Master Setup - Standalone](MasterSetupJazzy.md) instead — it sets up the same ROS 2 environment with a normal local account and no LDAP/NFS dependency.
- You only have a handful of machines and can simply assign one student (or a fixed pair) per machine for the term.

**The trade-off:** a login server buys you station-independence and central account management, at the cost of standing up and maintaining an extra server, plus a dependency on the network (mitigated in [Master (Client) Setup](login-client.md) with SSSD credential caching and soft NFS mounts). For ECE 387's AFA lab — a fixed set of 14 dedicated NUCs used by a rotating roster of ~30 students across sections — that trade-off is worth it.

**Key concept:** Student home directories live on the login server and are NFS-mounted on every master. When a student logs in to any master (set up per [Master (Client) Setup](login-client.md)), their home directory (`.bashrc`, SSH keys, ROS workspace) is automatically available — no per-machine setup needed.

> **Why not FreeIPA?** `freeipa-server` is not packaged for Ubuntu 24.04. OpenLDAP + SSSD is the standard replacement and provides the same centralized login and shared home directory functionality.

## Network Planning

Assign static IPs on your lab's network before starting. All machines must be on the same subnet so they can reach each other.

**Lab network:** WiFi router at `10.99.1.1`, SSID `ece387only`, subnet `10.99.1.0/24`.

| Host | Hostname | IP |
|------|----------|----|
| Login Server | `ece387server` | `10.99.1.50` |
| Master 01 | `master01` | `10.99.1.101` |
| Master 02 | `master02` | `10.99.1.102` |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Master 14 | `master14` | `10.99.1.114` |

> The login server IP (`10.99.1.50`) is the AFA lab address, reachable over the `ece387only` WiFi network at `10.99.1.1`. Master IPs above (`10.99.1.101`–`114`) are a suggested continuation of that range — adjust if you assign them differently. This guide uses the domain `ece387.local`.

---

## 1. Login Server Setup

### 1.0 Create a Working Directory

All scripts and configuration files for this setup are saved here so you can reference or reuse them later.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/ece387
```

### 1.1 Install Ubuntu 24.04 Server

1. Boot from Ubuntu 24.04 Server ISO.
2. During install, set:
   - Hostname: `ece387server`
   - Create a local admin account (e.g., `stanbaek`) — this is your admin account, separate from student accounts
   - Enable OpenSSH Server so you can manage the server remotely
3. After install, set a static IP so the server is always reachable at the same address:

```bash
# Find your ethernet interface name (look for something like enp86s0 or eno1)
ip a

# On Ubuntu Server installs, the netplan file created by cloud-init is
# usually 50-cloud-init.yaml, not 00-installer-config.yaml. Check which one
# exists on your machine first:
ls /etc/netplan/

sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp86s0:                      # replace with your actual interface name
      dhcp4: false
      addresses: [10.99.1.50/24]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 10.99.1.1          # WiFi router IP (ece387only)
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```

```bash
# Apply the network config — takes effect immediately without rebooting
sudo netplan apply
```

> **Careful with `50-cloud-init.yaml`:** cloud-init regenerates this file on every boot by default, which can silently revert your static IP back to DHCP after a reboot. To make the change stick, disable cloud-init's network management:
>
> ```bash
> sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
> ```
>
> ```yaml
> network: {config: disabled}
> ```
>
> This only stops cloud-init from touching networking on future boots — it does not affect the netplan file you just edited.

### 1.2 Set Hostname and /etc/hosts

The hostname tells the machine its own name. `/etc/hosts` maps that name to an IP address locally, which is required for LDAP to work correctly — LDAP uses the hostname to identify the server, and it must match the IP.

```bash
# Set the system hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ece387server
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

The file should contain:

```
127.0.0.1   localhost
10.99.1.50  ece387server.ece387.local  ece387server
```

> `ece387server.ece387.local` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN): machine name + domain. `ece387.local` is a private domain that exists only within your lab network — it is not registered on the public internet.

### 1.3 Install OpenLDAP

OpenLDAP is a directory service — think of it as a database that stores user accounts (usernames, UIDs, home directory paths, passwords). Every master computer will query this database to authenticate students.

```bash
# Update package list, then install:
#   slapd       — the OpenLDAP server daemon
#   ldap-utils  — command-line tools for querying/modifying the LDAP database
#   ldapscripts  — helper scripts for common tasks like adding users
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y slapd ldap-utils ldapscripts
```

During install you are prompted for an admin password — set a strong one (e.g., `LdapAdmin387!`). This is the LDAP admin password, not your Linux account password.

Now reconfigure the database to use your domain name. This step sets the "root" of the LDAP tree — everything hangs off `dc=ece387,dc=local`:

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd
```

Answer the prompts:

- Omit OpenLDAP server configuration? → **No**
- DNS domain name → `ece387.local`  *(this becomes dc=ece387,dc=local in LDAP)*
- Organization name → `ECE387`
- Admin password → `LdapAdmin387!` (confirm)
- Remove database when slapd is purged? → **No**
- Move old database? → **Yes**

Verify the server is running and the base structure is reachable:

```bash
# Check that slapd is active
sudo systemctl status slapd

# Query the LDAP server — it should return the base entry with no errors.
# -x         = simple authentication (no Kerberos)
# -H         = server URI
# -b         = base DN to search from
# -D         = who you're connecting as (the admin account)
# -W         = prompt for password
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -b "dc=ece387,dc=local" -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" -W
```

### 1.4 Create LDAP Structure

LDAP organizes entries in a tree. Before adding users, you need to create the "folders" (called organizational units, or `ou`) that hold them. This is like creating directories before putting files inside.

```bash
# Write the structure definition to a file in LDIF format.
# LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) is the text format used to describe
# entries you want to add, modify, or delete in the LDAP database.
cat > ~/Documents/ece387/structure.ldif << 'EOF'
# ou=students: holds all student user accounts
dn: ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: students

# ou=groups: holds group definitions
dn: ou=groups,dc=ece387,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: groups

# ece387students: the group all students belong to.
# gidNumber 10000 is the shared group ID assigned to all students.
dn: cn=ece387students,ou=groups,dc=ece387,dc=local
objectClass: posixGroup
cn: ece387students
gidNumber: 10000
EOF

# Add these entries to the LDAP database
# -f = read from file instead of stdin
ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost \
  -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" \
  -W -f ~/Documents/ece387/structure.ldif
```

### 1.5 Create Course Config Templates

Before creating student accounts, set up the course templates. These files are copied into every student's home directory at account creation and can be re-pushed at any time.

```bash
# Create the directory that will hold course-wide config files
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ece387
```

> **The shell environment is instructor-owned.** `.bashrc` and `.inputrc` are course files, not student files. Every push overwrites them, and student edits do not survive. This is deliberate: a uniform environment across all 62 accounts and 14 masters means a broken shell is always the template's fault and is always fixed in one place. Tell students up front that `~/.bashrc` is not theirs to edit — anything they want per-session goes in the terminal (`export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=7`), and anything they want permanently goes in a request to you.

#### .bashrc Template

`.bashrc` is sourced every time a terminal opens. Because `create_students.sh` copies this file *over* the student's `.bashrc`, the template must be a **complete** `.bashrc` — the Ubuntu defaults plus the course environment — not just the ECE 387 additions. A template containing only the course block produces accounts with no prompt, no history settings, and no `ls` colors.

Write it in one shot. The quoted `'TEMPLATE_EOF'` delimiter is required: it stops the shell from expanding `$@`, `$-`, `$(...)`, and `~` while the file is being written.

```bash
sudo tee /etc/ece387/bashrc_template > /dev/null << 'TEMPLATE_EOF'
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# ECE 387 course template — managed by the instructor, overwritten on every push.
# Do not edit this file on a student account; edit /etc/ece387/bashrc_template
# on the login server and re-push.

# If not running interactively, set the ROS environment and return early.
# This is what makes non-login commands work, e.g.:
#   ssh master05 'ros2 topic list'

TEMPLATE_EOF
```

Check the syntax before pushing it to 62 accounts - a typo here breaks every terminal in the lab at once:

```bash
bash -n /etc/ece387/bashrc_template && echo "syntax OK"
```

**Notes on the template:**

- The non-interactive guard sets the ROS variables *before* returning. The stock Ubuntu `.bashrc` returns immediately, which would leave `ssh master05 'ros2 topic list'` with no ROS environment. The variables are intentionally duplicated in the guard and in the course block below it - the guard `return`s before reaching the second copy, so keep the two in sync when you change one.
- Interactivity matters for more than convenience: without the guard, anything the course block prints to stdout corrupts `scp` and `rsync` transfers to and from the robots.
- `source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh` is **not** included. That path belongs to Gazebo Classic, which is not part of Jazzy - on a Jazzy master the file does not exist and every terminal opens with a "No such file or directory" error. If a future setup does need it, guard the source: `[ -f /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh ] && source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh`.
- `robotX` in the `bringup` alias is a placeholder. Either replace it before the first push or teach students to use `ssh_robot` and launch bringup by hand.

#### .inputrc Template

`.inputrc` configures readline behavior - used by bash for history search and tab completion.

```bash
sudo tee /etc/ece387/inputrc_template > /dev/null << 'EOF'
# ~/.inputrc: readline initialization file.
# ECE 387 course template — managed by the instructor, overwritten on every push.

# Start from the system defaults. Without this line, ~/.inputrc REPLACES
# /etc/inputrc entirely rather than adding to it.
$include /etc/inputrc

# Arrow keys search history based on what's already typed
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Case-insensitive tab completion
set completion-ignore-case on
EOF
```

Readline fails silently on a bad binding — a typo does not error, the key just does nothing. Test before pushing:

```bash
bind -f /etc/ece387/inputrc_template && echo "readline accepted it"
```

> **`$include` is not optional.** Unlike `.bashrc`, a user's `~/.inputrc` does not layer on top of `/etc/inputrc` — readline reads the user file *instead of* the system file. Without the include line, students silently lose the Ubuntu defaults.

> **Readline reads `.inputrc` only at shell startup.** After a push, `source ~/.bashrc` will not pick up `.inputrc` changes; students need a fresh terminal.

#### Pushing Updates to All Students

The templates are copied automatically only when accounts are first created. To push changes to all existing students at any time:

```bash
for dir in /home/students/a27-*/; do
  user=$(basename "$dir")
  # Read the UID from the home directory itself. Do NOT use `id -u "$user"`:
  # the login server hosts LDAP but is not an LDAP *client*, so NSS on this
  # machine cannot resolve student names and `id` fails silently.
  uid=$(stat -c %u "$dir")
  sudo cp /etc/ece387/bashrc_template "${dir}.bashrc"   || { echo "FAILED: $user"; continue; }
  sudo cp /etc/ece387/inputrc_template "${dir}.inputrc" || { echo "FAILED: $user"; continue; }
  sudo chown "${uid}:10000" "${dir}.bashrc" "${dir}.inputrc"
  echo "Updated: $user (uid=$uid)"
done
```

Verify ownership afterward. The glob must be expanded *inside* the elevated shell — student home directories are `chmod 700`, so your own shell cannot expand a path that reaches into them:

```bash
# Empty output = all accounts correct
sudo find /home/students -maxdepth 2 -name '.bashrc' -user root
```

> **This overwrites `.bashrc` and `.inputrc` unconditionally.** Anything a student added to either file is gone. That is the intended behavior — the shell environment is course-managed. `chown` is required because `sudo cp` leaves the copies owned by `root`; inside a `chmod 700` home directory that is confusing to debug later even though bash will still source them.

Run the push from the login server, not from a master — the home directories live here. Students pick up the change at their next login, or immediately with `source ~/.bashrc`.

> **Verify on one account before pushing to all 62.** Copy the template to a single student, log in as them on a master, and confirm the prompt, `ros2 topic list`, and `ccbuild` all behave. A bad template pushed to every account takes down every bench at once.

### 1.6 Create Student Accounts

Student IDs follow two series this term: `a27-m0` through `a27-m30` (31 accounts) and `a27-t0` through `a27-t30` (31 accounts) — 62 accounts total. The script below:

1. Generates a hashed password for all accounts
2. Builds a single LDIF file with all 62 user entries
3. Creates each student's home directory on the server and populates it with the course `.bashrc`
4. Adds all accounts to LDAP in one command

UID numbers are split into two non-overlapping ranges so the two series never collide: `m` series uses `20000`–`20030`, `t` series uses `21000`–`21030`.

```bash
cat > ~/Documents/ece387/create_students.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Exit immediately if any command fails
set -e

# --- Configuration ---
LDAP_ADMIN_DN="cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local"
LDAP_ADMIN_PW="LdapAdmin387!"    # your LDAP admin password
INITIAL_PW="TempPass2024!"        # students change this on first login
LDIF=~/Documents/ece387/students.ldif

# Generate a single password hash to reuse for all accounts.
# slappasswd hashes the password in a format OpenLDAP understands ({SSHA}...).
HASH=$(slappasswd -s "$INITIAL_PW")

# Clear the LDIF file if it already exists from a previous run
> $LDIF

# Two username series this term: a27-m0..a27-m30 and a27-t0..a27-t30.

  local PREFIX=$1     # "m" or "t"
  local UID_BASE=$2   # 20000 for m-series, 21000 for t-series

  # Loop from 0 to 30, creating one LDAP entry per student
  for i in $(seq 0 30); do
    USERNAME="a27-${PREFIX}${i}"
    UID_NUMBER=$((UID_BASE + i))

### 1.7 Configure NFS Home Directories

NFS (Network File System) lets the master computers mount the server's `/home/students` directory as if it were a local disk. When a student logs in to any master, their home directory appears from the server.

```bash
# Install the NFS server package
sudo apt install -y nfs-kernel-server

# Create the parent directory that holds all student home directories.
# Individual student dirs (a27-m0, a27-m1, ..., a27-t0, a27-t1, ...) were already created in 1.6.
sudo mkdir -p /home/students
sudo chmod 755 /home/students
```

Edit the NFS exports file to define what is shared and who can access it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/exports
```

```
# Share /home/students with all machines on the 10.99.1.0/24 subnet.
# rw             = read and write access
# sync           = write data to disk before acknowledging — safer than async
# no_subtree_check = disables subtree checking, improves reliability
# no_root_squash = allows root on clients to act as root here (needed for
#                  creating/chowning files during setup)
/home/students  10.99.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
# Note: this matches the ece387only WiFi router subnet (10.99.1.0/24)
```

```bash
# Re-read /etc/exports and apply the new export
sudo exportfs -rav

# Enable and start the NFS server
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server

# Verify the export is listed — should show /home/students
showmount -e localhost
```

> `no_root_squash` is used here to simplify initial account creation. Once accounts are set up, switch to `root_squash` for better isolation between students — see "Grant Students Restricted sudo Access" in [login-client.md](login-client.md).

### 1.8 Open Required Firewall Ports

```bash
# Allow SSH so you can manage the server remotely
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

# Allow LDAP queries from master computers (port 389)
sudo ufw allow 389/tcp

# Allow NFS traffic (port 2049)
sudo ufw allow 2049/tcp

# Allow rpcbind/portmapper (port 111) — required for showmount and NFS negotiation
sudo ufw allow 111/tcp
sudo ufw allow 111/udp

# Allow all traffic from the lab subnet
sudo ufw allow from 10.99.1.0/24

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Verify the rules
sudo ufw status
```

> **Reconfiguring an already-running server:** if `sudo ufw status` still shows an old subnet (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`) from a previous setup, `ufw allow` won't replace it — the old rule stays active alongside the new one. Remove it explicitly:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ufw status numbered      # find the rule number for the old subnet
> sudo ufw delete <number>      # delete it
> sudo ufw allow from 10.99.1.0/24
> sudo ufw status
> ```

Once the server is up, continue to [login-client.md](login-client.md) to configure each master to authenticate against it.

---

## 2. Resilience — Server Down or Network Unreliable

**Authentication (SSSD):** Handled on the client side — after a student logs in once, SSSD on each master caches their credentials locally so they can still log in if the login server goes down. See [login-client.md](login-client.md).

**Home directories (NFS):** If the NFS server is unreachable, students lose access to `.bashrc`, SSH keys, and their ROS workspace on any master. Mitigations (GitHub as a safety net, soft NFS mounts) are configured on the client side — see [login-client.md](login-client.md).

## 3. Maintenance

### Add a new student

```bash
# Step 1: Generate a hashed password for the new student
slappasswd -s NewStudentPass!
# Copy the {SSHA}... output

# Step 2: Add the account to LDAP
# Use the next free uidNumber in the right series:
#   m series (a27-m0..m30):  20000-20030
#   t series (a27-t0..t30):  21000-21030
# e.g. a new t-series student a27-t31 gets uidNumber 21031
ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost \
  -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" -W << 'EOF'
dn: uid=a27-t31,ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: shadowAccount
uid: a27-t31
cn: a27-t31
sn: a27-t31
uidNumber: 21031
gidNumber: 10000
homeDirectory: /home/students/a27-t31
loginShell: /bin/bash
userPassword: {SSHA}PASTE_HASH_HERE
EOF

# Step 3: Create the home directory on the server
sudo mkdir -p /home/students/a27-t31
sudo cp -r /etc/skel/. /home/students/a27-t31/
sudo cp /etc/ece387/bashrc_template /home/students/a27-t31/.bashrc
sudo cp /etc/ece387/inputrc_template /home/students/a27-t31/.inputrc
sudo chown -R 21031:10000 /home/students/a27-t31
sudo chmod 700 /home/students/a27-t31
```

### Reset a student password

```bash
# Replace a27-m0 with the student's username, and set the new password with -s
ldappasswd -H ldap://localhost \
  -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" \
  -W -s NewPassword! \
  "uid=a27-m0,ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local"
```

### Remove all students for a class year (year-end rollover)

Class-year prefixes change every year (`a27` = class of 2027, `a28` = class of 2028, etc.). Run this once at the start of a new year, right before running `create_students.sh` for the incoming class. It takes a prefix, backs up the LDAP database and matching home directories first, then deletes the LDAP entries and home directories for every account matching that prefix (both `m` and `t` series, since they share the same `a27-*` prefix).

```bash
cat > ~/Documents/ece387/remove_students.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Removes ALL student accounts for a given class-year prefix (e.g. a27)
# and deletes their home directories. Backs up LDAP + home dirs first.
set -e

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <prefix>   e.g. $0 a27"
  exit 1
fi

PREFIX=$1
LDAP_ADMIN_DN="cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local"
LDAP_ADMIN_PW="LdapAdmin387!"    # your LDAP admin password
BASE_DN="ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local"

echo "This will PERMANENTLY delete all LDAP accounts and home directories"
echo "matching '${PREFIX}-*' under ${BASE_DN} (covers both m and t series)."
read -p "Type the prefix again to confirm (${PREFIX}): " CONFIRM
if [ "$CONFIRM" != "$PREFIX" ]; then
  echo "Confirmation did not match. Aborting."
  exit 1
fi

# --- Step 1: Back up before deleting anything ---
BACKUP_DIR=~/Documents/ece387/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)-${PREFIX}
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR/home"

echo "Backing up full LDAP database to ${BACKUP_DIR}/ldap-backup.ldif ..."
sudo slapcat > "${BACKUP_DIR}/ldap-backup.ldif"

echo "Backing up home directories matching ${PREFIX}-* to ${BACKUP_DIR}/home ..."
sudo rsync -av --include="${PREFIX}-*" --include="${PREFIX}-*/**" --exclude="*" \
  /home/students/ "${BACKUP_DIR}/home/"

# --- Step 2: Find all matching uids in LDAP ---
USERS=$(ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost \
  -b "$BASE_DN" -D "$LDAP_ADMIN_DN" -w "$LDAP_ADMIN_PW" \
  "(uid=${PREFIX}-*)" uid | grep "^uid:" | awk '{print $2}')

if [ -z "$USERS" ]; then
  echo "No accounts found matching ${PREFIX}-*. Nothing to remove."
  exit 0
fi

echo "Found $(echo "$USERS" | wc -l) accounts to remove:"
echo "$USERS"
echo ""

# --- Step 3: Delete each LDAP entry ---
for USERNAME in $USERS; do
  echo "Deleting LDAP entry: uid=${USERNAME}"
  ldapdelete -x -H ldap://localhost \
    -D "$LDAP_ADMIN_DN" -w "$LDAP_ADMIN_PW" \
    "uid=${USERNAME},${BASE_DN}"
done

# --- Step 4: Remove home directories ---
for USERNAME in $USERS; do
  echo "Removing home directory: /home/students/${USERNAME}"
  sudo rm -rf "/home/students/${USERNAME}"
done

echo ""
echo "Done. Removed accounts matching '${PREFIX}-*'."
echo "Backup saved to: ${BACKUP_DIR}"
EOF

chmod +x ~/Documents/ece387/remove_students.sh
```

Run it with the outgoing class prefix, e.g.:

```bash
bash ~/Documents/ece387/remove_students.sh a27
```

Then create the incoming class with the new prefix by editing the `create_series` calls in `create_students.sh` (or parameterizing them the same way) before re-running it.

> **Group and OU structure are untouched** — this only removes entries under `ou=students`. `ou=groups` and the `ece387students` group (gidNumber 10000) stay in place and are reused every year.

### List all student accounts

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost \
  -b "ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local" \
  -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" \
  -W uid cn
```

### Back up home directories and LDAP database

```bash
# Sync all student home directories to a backup location
sudo rsync -av /home/students/ /backup/students/

# Export the entire LDAP database to a text file (LDIF format)
# This file can be used to restore the database on a new server
sudo slapcat > ~/Documents/ece387/ldap-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).ldif
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Command | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Student can't log in | `ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -b "ou=students,dc=ece387,dc=local" -D "cn=admin,dc=ece387,dc=local" -W "(uid=a27-m0)"` | Check account exists; verify password hash is valid |
| LDAP connection refused | `ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.99.1.50 -b "dc=ece387,dc=local" -x` | Check `systemctl status slapd` on server |
| NFS mount fails (from a client) | `showmount -e 10.99.1.50` | Check firewall on server; verify `nfs-server` is running |

For client-side symptoms (home directory not mounting, SSSD not resolving users, login hangs or is slow), see the troubleshooting table in [login-client.md](login-client.md).
