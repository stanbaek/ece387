## **Overview of the Game**

This simplified version of the Risk board game involves:
- Two players (a user and the computer).
- Recruiting armies with different unit types (`Footman`, `Archer`, `Knight`, and `SiegeMachine`).
- Taking turns to attack until one side is defeated.
- Using dice rolls to determine attack outcomes.




### **Rules for This Simplified Risk Game**

This version of Risk is a simplified, turn-based game involving two players: the **user** and the **computer**. Players recruit armies within a budget and take turns attacking each other until one side is eliminated. The game is played as follows:

---

### **1. Game Setup**
- **Players**: There are two players:
  - **User**: You, the player.
  - **Computer**: Controlled by the program.
- **Budget**: Each player starts with a fixed number of coins to recruit their army. By default, this budget is 30 coins.
- **Unit Types**:
  - **Footman**: Cost: 1 coin, Health: 1, Hit Threshold: 5+
  - **Archer**: Cost: 2 coins, Health: 1, Hit Threshold: 4+
  - **Knight**: Cost: 3 coins, Health: 2, Hit Threshold: 3+
  - **Siege Machine**: Cost: 10 coins, Health: 3, Hit Threshold: 3+ (rolls two dice when attacking)
- **Recruitment**: 
  - Players recruit units randomly until their budget runs out.
  - A maximum of **2 Siege Machines** can be recruited per player.

---

### **2. Combat Mechanics**
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**:
  - The **user** attacks first, followed by the **computer**.
  - Players alternate turns until one side is completely defeated.

- **Attacking**:
  - Players attack with one type of unit at a time (in the order: Siege Machine â†’ Archer â†’ Knight â†’ Footman).
  - Each unit rolls dice to determine how many hits they score:
    - A unit scores a hit if the dice roll is greater than or equal to its **hit threshold**.
    - **Footman, Archer, and Knight** roll one die.
    - **Siege Machines** roll two dice.
  - The total number of hits is calculated and applied to the opposing player.

- **Defending**:
  - The defending player absorbs hits by assigning damage to random units in their army.
  - Units with zero health are eliminated and removed from the army.

---

### **3. End of Game**
- The game ends when one player's army is completely defeated.
- The remaining player's army is declared the winner.
- The program displays:
  - The composition of the winning army.
  - A message announcing the winner.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
1. **Recruitment Phase**:
   - Both players recruit units based on their budget. For example:
     - User: 2 Footmen, 1 Archer, 1 Knight, 1 Siege Machine.
     - Computer: 3 Footmen, 2 Archers, 1 Knight.
   - The composition of each army is displayed before the battle begins.

2. **Battle Phase**:
   - **Turn 1**: 
     - User's Siege Machine rolls two dice and scores 1 hit. The hit is applied to a random unit in the computer's army.
     - Computer's Siege Machine rolls two dice and scores 2 hits. The hits are applied to the user's units.
   - **Subsequent Turns**:
     - Both players alternate attacking with their next unit types (e.g., Archers, Knights).
     - Damage is applied to the defending player's army after each attack.

3. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when one player's army is eliminated. The program announces the winner and shows the remaining army of the victorious player.

---

### **Key Differences from the Original Risk Game**
- This version simplifies recruitment and combat:
  - There is no board or territorial control.
  - Armies are recruited randomly, and players have fixed budgets.
  - Combat is resolved by alternating turns, with no simultaneous attacks or strategic maneuvers.
- Unit roles and dice mechanics are adjusted for simplicity.

---

This straightforward set of rules ensures that the focus remains on implementing and understanding the **object-oriented programming concepts** behind the game.





---

## **Setup**

1. Open your Python development environment (e.g., VS Code or PyCharm).
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new `.py` file.
3. Follow the instructions in each **`TODO`** section to complete the missing functionality.

---

## **Classes and Responsibilities**

### **1. `Unit` Class**
- Represents a generic unit in the game.
- Attributes include:
  - `name`: The name of the unit.
  - `cost`: How much it costs to recruit this unit.
  - `health`: The unit's health points.
  - `hit_threshold`: The minimum dice roll needed for the unit to score a hit.
- **Methods**:
  - `roll_attack()`: Simulates a dice roll and determines if the unit scores a hit.
  - `take_damage(damage)`: Reduces the unit's health by the specified damage.
    - **TODO**: Subtract the damage value from `self.health` and ensure health doesnâ€™t go below 0.
  - `isalive()`: Checks if the unit is still alive (health > 0).
    - **TODO**: Return `True` if health > 0, else return `False`.

#### **Tasks for Students**
1. **Complete the `take_damage` method**:
   - Use the `max()` function to ensure health doesnâ€™t drop below 0.
   ```python
   self.health = max(self.health - damage, 0)
   ```
2. **Complete the `isalive` method**:
   - Check the value of `self.health` and return a boolean.

---

### **2. Subclasses (`Footman`, `Archer`, `Knight`, `SiegeMachine`)**
- Inherit from the `Unit` class.
- Each unit type has specific attributes for `cost`, `health`, and `hit_threshold`.
- **SiegeMachine Special Ability**:
  - Rolls **two dice** instead of one for its attack.
  - **TODO**: Implement the `roll_attack` method in the `SiegeMachine` class to roll two dice and count the hits.

#### **Tasks for Students**
1. **Modify `roll_attack` in `SiegeMachine`**:
   - Use a loop to roll two dice.
   - Count how many rolls are greater than or equal to `hit_threshold`.
   ```python
   hits = 0
   for _ in range(2):
       roll = random.randint(1, 6)
       print(f"{self.name} rolls {roll}.")
       if roll >= self.hit_threshold:
           hits += 1
   return hits
   ```

---

### **3. `Player` Class**
- Represents a player (user or computer).
- Attributes include:
  - `name`: The player's name.
  - `budget`: Coins available for recruiting units.
  - `army`: List of units the player has recruited.
- **Methods**:
  - `recruit_units()`: Randomly recruits units within the player's budget.
    - **TODO**: Enforce the maximum number of Siege Machines (`MaxSiegeUnits`) allowed.
  - `attack(defender)`: Simulates an attack on another player.
    - **TODO**: Roll dice for units of the current type and calculate the total hits.
  - `resolve_damage(total_damage)`: Applies damage to the player's units.
    - **TODO**: Randomly pick units to take damage, remove units with zero health, and print eliminated units.

#### **Tasks for Students**
1. **Complete `recruit_units`**:
   - Skip recruiting Siege Machines if `siege_count >= MaxSiegeUnits`.
   ```python
   if isinstance(unit, SiegeMachine) and siege_count >= self.MaxSiegeUnits:
       continue
   ```
2. **Complete `attack`**:
   - Loop through `self.army` and roll dice for units of the current type (`army_type`).
   - Add hits to `total_hits` and print results.
   ```python
   if isinstance(unit, army_type) and unit.isalive():
       hits = unit.roll_attack()
       total_hits += hits
       print(f"{unit} scores {hits} hit(s).")
   ```
3. **Complete `resolve_damage`**:
   - While `total_damage > 0`, randomly pick units from `self.army` using `random.choice()`.
   - Apply 1 damage to the selected unit, remove dead units, and print their names.
   ```python
   while total_damage > 0 and self.army:
       unit = random.choice(self.army)
       unit.take_damage(1)
       if not unit.isalive():
           print(f"{unit.name} has been eliminated!")
           self.army.remove(unit)
       total_damage -= 1
   ```

---

### **4. `Risk` Class**
- Represents the overall game.
- Attributes:
  - `user`: The human player.
  - `computer`: The AI opponent.
- **Methods**:
  - `play()`: Runs the game loop until one player is defeated.
  - Prints the final outcome of the game.

---

## **Steps to Complete the Lab**

1. **Understand the Code**:
   - Read through each class and its methods.
   - Pay attention to the `TODO` sections.

2. **Implement the Missing Functionality**:
