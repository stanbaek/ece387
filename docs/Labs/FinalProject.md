# üöÄ Final Project

```{attention}
Read this page thoroughly before you start working on this final project.   
```

## üìå Objectives  

- Students will integrate concepts from earlier modules to design and implement a complete robotic system capable of handling complex tasks using ROS2.  
- Students will demonstrate proficiency in robotic systems by building task-specific machines with onboard computing.  
- Students will apply knowledge from across the course to develop, test, and deliver a functional final project.

## üìú Overview  

In this final project, you‚Äôll combine everything you‚Äôve learned throughout the course to design and implement a complete robotic system using ROS2. The project challenges you to create a robot that solves real-world tasks, requiring multiple components to work together seamlessly.  

Your robot will navigate a maze in the lab, employing technologies from previous modules:  
- **LIDAR:** Keeps the robot centered between walls.  
- **IMU:** Handles precise turns (90¬∞, -90¬∞, 270¬∞).  
- **OpenCV:** Detects and reacts to randomly placed stop signs.  
- **AprilTags:** Guides the robot through the maze using tag IDs and distances to decide actions like turning or stopping at specific locations.  

```{important}
If you notice any discrepancies in the project description or grading criteria, the correct information will follow this order of priority: (1) Instructor messages via Teams, (2) this Course Web, (3) Gradescope, and (4) the project overview slides. The Course Web will always be updated immediately to reflect any changes, and outdated instructions will be clearly crossed out.
```

## Story  

Ahoy, crew! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The infamous pirate captain, Dr. Baek, has uncovered an ancient scroll that reveals the location of a hidden treasure island. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîthe treasure is locked deep inside a deadly maze! 

According to the scroll, the maze is marked with enigmatic symbols known as AprilTags. These cryptic signs hold the key to locating the treasure. Miss one, or read it wrong, and... well, let‚Äôs just say you won‚Äôt be making it back.

Rather than risking life and limb in the perilous maze, the legendary pirate captain, Dr. Baek, is turning to cutting-edge technology to solve the mystery. Your task is to design and build a robotic system capable of navigating the maze independently, decoding the AprilTags, and uncovering the treasure's hidden location.

Here‚Äôs what the scroll reveals about navigating the maze:  
1. **Follow the walls in the maze at all times.**  
2. **Avoid stopping at or looking out windows‚Äîthose are deadly!**  
3. **React to AprilTags:**  
   - **Tag ID 0:** Turn left (make a 270¬∞ clockwise turn).  
   - **Tag ID 1:** Stop for 5 seconds, then make a 90¬∞ left turn.  
   - **Tag ID 2:** Turn right (make a 90¬∞ clockwise turn).  
   - **Tag ID 3:** Turn left (make a 90¬∞ counterclockwise turn).  
   - **Stop Signs:** Stop 0.3 meters before the sign, then turn left. Look around to locate the treasure chest, which is buried under **AprilTag ID 4**.  

Once you locate the treasure chest, send Captain Baek the maze map so he can claim the loot!

## üéÆ Final Project Gamesmanship

### 1. Demo & Coding (40 points)  
- Review the presentation and final report requirements **before** you begin coding.  
- **Start early**‚Äîdelays can put your completion at risk.  
- Use the code from Labs 10 and 11 as a reference, but **do not** implement your project within those lab files. Instructors will evaluate the code inside your `final_project` folder.  
- Take advantage of debugging tools like `rqt`, `ros2 topic`, and `rviz` to fine-tune high-level behaviors.  
- **Prioritize your final report:**  
  - Your analysis in the report is more important than completing the maze.  
  - Manage your time carefully‚Äîdon‚Äôt sacrifice report quality for extra demo points. Losing 10 points on the report to earn 5 points in the demo isn‚Äôt worth it!  

### 2. Presentation (20 points)  
- **Make visuals a priority!** Figures, tables, and graphs often communicate concepts better than lengthy explanations.  
- **Cover all required details** in your presentation.  
- Stick to the **5-minute limit**‚Äîpractice to refine your delivery. At the 6-minute mark, your talk will be stopped, and any content beyond that **won‚Äôt** be graded. Time management is key, just as it is in professional conferences.  
- **Practice, practice, practice.** Short presentations that lack detail often result in lost points. Even experienced engineers practice for their conference presentations.

### 3. Final Report (40 points)  
- Carefully **follow the template** and ensure all required sections are included.  
- Strengthen your analysis with figures and tables to clearly present your findings.  
- If you opt for an in-person demo, **also** submit a video demo that aligns with your report‚Äôs plots to support your documentation.

## üé¨ Demonstrations  

Below is the final grading rubric, with a total of **40 points** assigned to the demonstration:  

1. **Wall Following (10 points):**  
  - The robot must follow the maze walls without colliding.  
  - Each wall collision results in a **1-point deduction**.  
  - However, if the robot successfully reaches the final goal (yellow line), no more than **3 points** will be deducted.  

1. **Stop Sign (8 points):**  
  - The robot must stop at the **yellow line**, with its bottom plate covering any part of it.  
  - Once the treasure chest is found, the robot should **print its current location** and remain there indefinitely.  

1. **AprilTags (15 points):**  
  - The robot must stop at the **orange line** before turning.  
  - Its bottom plate must cover at least part of the orange line before executing a turn.  
  - Precise turns aren't directly graded, but improving turn accuracy will **boost overall performance**.  

1. **Map Generation (5 points):**
