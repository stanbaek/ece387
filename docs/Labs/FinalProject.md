# üöÄ Final Project


## NOT READY YET



```{attention}
Read this page thoroughly before you start working on this final project.   
```


## üìå Objectives  

- Students will integrate concepts from earlier modules to design and implement a complete robotic system capable of handling complex tasks using ROS2.  
- Students will demonstrate proficiency in robotic systems by building task-specific machines with onboard computing.  
- Students will apply knowledge from across the course to develop, test, and deliver a functional final project.


## üìú Agenda

The final project brings together everything you've learned throughout the course. It challenges you to design and build a complete robotic system using ROS2 that can solve a real-world task with multiple components working together. This project emphasizes embedded, task-specific robotics and is where you apply your accumulated knowledge in a hands-on, functional way.

Your robot will operate in the maze in the lab, using a combination of technologies from previous modules. LIDAR will help it stay centered between walls, the IMU will handle precise turns (90¬∞, 180¬∞, 360¬∞), and OpenCV will detect and respond to randomly placed stop signs. Additionally, you'll use AprilTags to guide the robot through the maze ‚Äînavigating based on tag ID and distance to determine whether it should turn left, right, around, or stop at its goal.

```{important}
If you notice any discrepancies in the project description or grading criteria, the correct information will follow this order of priority: (1) Instructor messages via Teams, (2) this Course Web, (3) Gradescope, and (4) the project overview slides. The Course Web will always be updated immediately to reflect any changes, and outdated instructions will be clearly crossed out.
```

##  Synopsis

üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Ahoy, crew! The infamous pirate captain, Dr. Baek, has discovered an ancient scroll that reveals the location of a hidden treasure island. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîthe treasure is locked deep inside a deadly maze! 

According to the scroll, the maze is filled with mysterious symbols called AprilTags. These symbols are the only clues that lead to the treasure. Miss one, or read it wrong, and... well, let‚Äôs just say you won‚Äôt be making it back.

But instead of risking life and limb, Captain Baek wants to use some good ol' 21st-century tech. That‚Äôs where you come in. Your mission: build a robotic system that can explore the maze on its own, follow the AprilTags, and find the treasure.

Here is what the scroll says
    - You must follow the walls in the maze. 
    - Do not stop at windows or look out of the windows as they are so deadly.
    - At AprilTag ID 0, you must turn left. Make sure you make a 270$^\circ$ clockwise turn. 
    - At AprilTag ID 1, you must stop and pause for 5 seconds then make a 90$^\circ$ left turn.
    - At AprilTag ID 2, you must turn right. Make sure you make a 90$^\circ$ clockwise turn. 
    - At AprilTag ID 3, you must turn left. Make sure you make a 90$^\circ$ counterclockwise turn. 
    - At a stop sign, you must stop from 0.3 meters from the stop sign, then make a left turn. The treasure chest is located around there.  Now you should look around to find the exact location of it. The treasure chest is buried right under AprilTag ID 4.
    

## üéÆ Final Project Gamesmanship

1. Demo and coding (40 points)
    - Read the presentation and final report requirements before you start coding.
    - Start early to earn early-bird bonus points; delay may jeopardize timely completion.
    - Use the code from Labs 10 and 11 as foundations, but avoid implementing your final project in these lab files. Instructors will review the code inside the `final_project` folder. 
    - Employ `rqt`, `ros2 topic`, and `rviz` extensively for debugging high-level behaviors. 
    - **Cease work for the final report**
        - Your analysis in the report is much more important than completing the maze. 
        - Balance time spent on coding and demo; don't sacrifice report quality for demos. Don't lose 30 points on the report to earn 15 demo points.
        - If your robot reaches only halfway to the Level 1 goal point, the deduction will be approximately 5-10 points.

1. Presentation (20 points)
    - Utilize visual aids a lot! Figures, tables, and graphs are more helpful than words.
    - Ensure you **discuss everything** in the presentation section.
    - Adhere to the 5-minute time limit; practice for effective delivery. Your talk will be stopped at the 6-minute mark, and credit will not be given for parts not discussed. Adhering to the time limit for presentations is a basic etiquette. Even at professional conferences, talks can be cut short if they exceed the allotted time.
    - You are strongly recommended to practice your talk. Students who gave very short presentations to avoid exceeding the time limit often did not discuss enough details and lost even more points. So, practice! Even experienced engineers practice for their conference presentations.

1. Report (40 points)
    - Thoroughly Read the template and **do not miss anything in the template**.
    - Use figures and tables to support your analysis and results.
    - While in-person demos are accepted, ensure submission of video demos aligned with the plots in your report.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Timeline

1. L36 0700: Design Presentation slides (Gradescope and Instructors)
    - Submit your `MS PowerPoint pptx` file to your instructor NLT L36 0700. Your slides will be played on your instructor's PC for smooth transitions between speakers. Make sure to send a pptx file and not a Keynote file or Google Slides unless your instructor has approved it.
    - Additionally, submit the PDF version of your presentation file on Gradescope no later than L36 0700. 
    - **_No grace days_** can be used for the PowerPoint slides.
1. L36: Design Presentations
1. L39 0700: Live demo Due   
    - Late Demos: You can use grace days, but all products must be submitted NLT T40 2359 (by the Dean's policy). 
1. T40 2359: Final report & Code
    - No grace days can be used. All products must be submitted by midnight on T40. 

### Requirements

1. Add comprehensive comments throughout your code. Emphasize the importance of thorough commenting.
1. Avoid delays, loops, waits, or sleeps in code.  Since you need to use a timer, adding delays, loops, or waits will interfere with the timer. The timer it self is actually a loop running forever.


### Deductions
- Deductions of up to 5 points will apply if delays or loops exist within the controller. 
- A penalty of up to 5 points will be incurred for poor coding practices, such as inadequate comments or the excessive use of hard-coded numbers instead of variables or enumerated types.


## üé¨ Demonstrations 

Demonstrations will be accomplished on lesson 39 in the maze. Points will be deducted for failed checkpoints (e.g., does not stop and turn within approximately 2 meters of AprilTag 0). The final rubric is below and a total of **40 points** assigned to the demonstration:

- Wall following [10 points]: The robot should follow the walls without hitting them. A deduction of 1 point for each wall collision will be applied. No more than 5 points will be deducted if the robot reaches the end goal ($\pm$30 cm from the yellow line).  
- Stop sign [10 points]: The robot should stop at the yellow line. The bottom plate of the robot should cover any part of the yellow line. Once the treasure chest is located, print out the current location of the robot and stay there forever. 
- AprilTags [20 points]: The robot should stop at the orange line before making any turns. The bottom plate of the robot should cover any part of the orange line. Then, the robot should make a turn. Although the exact angle of the turns will not be accessed, you might want to get precise turns as it affect the overall performance of the robot.



## üë©‚Äçüè´ Design Presentation (20 Points)

Provide a **5-minute** presentation followed by approximately 2 minutes for Q&A, covering the following topics:
