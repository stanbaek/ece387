## üìå Objectives

- Students should be able to


## Lesson Objectives:
1. Gain additional familiarity with simulation environment
1. Gain familiarity with Turtlebot 3 robotics platform
1. Practice with ROS diagnostic tools

## Agenda:
1. Use Linux terminals to launch and control Turtlebot 3 in simulation environment.
1. Use Linux terminals to launch and control actual Turtlebot 3.




## üìú Overview
This lab will introduce you to utilizing pre-built ROS packages to accomplish a task. It will also provide you experience interacting with someone else's source code (.py files) to learn how that component works. You will use ROS to run two nodes, **turtlebot3_core** and **teleop_twist_keyboard**, to drive the Turtlebot3 with a keyboard. You will continue to practice using ROS tools to observe how these components communicate.



## üíª Lab Procedure

### Working with a Remote Machine

In this course, you'll drive your TurtleBot without the need for a monitor and keyboard. However, you'll still need access to the Raspberry Pi on the robot to run ROS nodes. One of the easiest ways to remotely access a Linux machine is through a secure shell (SSH). To create an SSH connection, you'll need the username and hostname (or IP address) of the computer you want to access. For the Raspberry Pis, the username is `pi` and the hostname is your robot number (e.g., `robot98`).

(AccessPoint)=
1. **Connect to the Robot's Wi-Fi Network**:
    - Click the system menu in the top-right corner to open the Wi-Fi Networks setting.
    - Choose `RobotXX`, where `XX` corresponds to the `XX` in `MasterXX`.

    <br>

1. **Check Connectivity**:
    - The Raspberry Pi on your robot acts as a Wi-Fi access point (AP), allowing communication with your master computer.
    - Open a terminal on your master computer.
    - Check connectivity to the robot using its IP address, `192.168.4.1`:
      ```sh
      ping 192.168.4.1
      ```

1. **Create a Secure Shell Connection**: To access the robot remotely, create an SSH connection:
      ```sh
      ssh pi@192.168.4.1
      ```
      > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `ssh <username>@<hostname/IP address>`

1. **Enter the Robot's Password**: After entering the robot's password, the terminal should display the `pi` username and your robot's hostname, `robotX`. Any commands you run in this shell will execute on the robot.

1. **Change Your Password**: 
    - Once logged in, type the following command:
        ```bash
        passwd
        ```
    - You will be prompted to enter your **current password**. Type it and press **Enter**.
    - Next, you will be asked to enter a **new password**. Type a password and press **Enter**.
    - Retype the **new password** to confirm and press **Enter**.  If successful, you will see the message:
        ```
        password updated successfully
        ```

    - To ensure that your new password works, you can open a new terminal and try logging in again:
        ```bash
        ssh pi@192.168.4.1
        ```
        Enter the **new password** when prompted.

1. **Edit the `.bashrc` File**:
    - Open the `.bashrc` file by running the following command:
      ```sh
      nano ~/.bashrc
      ```   
   - You should see the following lines at the bottom of the `.bashrc` file:
      ```bash
      source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
      source ~/robot_ws/install/setup.bash
      source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh
      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0  # For master0 and robot0
      export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/humble/
      export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
      export LDS_MODEL=LDS-01  # Replace with LDS-02 if using new LIDAR
      source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
      ```
    - Your `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=XX` should match your computer ID, where `XX` corresponds to the `XX` in `MasterXX`.
    - The robots for our class have two different LIDAR variants: LDS-01 and LDS-02 (pictured below).
        ```{image} ./figures/Lab5_LDS.png
        :width: 480
        :align: center
        ```
        <br>
    - If you have the LDS-02, update `export LDS_MODEL=LDS-01` to `export LDS_MODEL=LDS-02` inside the `.bashrc` file.
    - Save the changes and exit the editor.
    
1. **Close the SSH Connection**: You can type `exit` to close the SSH connection.


### Updating the Hosts File on Master

As it is much easier to remember and use the host name than the IP address, let's modify the `hosts` file so that the master computer recognizes the host name of the Raspberry Pi.

```{warning}
Ensure that you execute the commands in this section on the **Master** computer. Do not execute them on the Raspberry Pi.
```

1. **Update the Hosts File on Master**: To add the robot's IP address to the hosts file, follow these steps on the **`Master`** computer:
    ```sh
    sudo gedit /etc/hosts
    ```
    Add the following line to the file:
    ```sh
    192.168.4.1    robotXX
    ```
    Replace `robotXX` with your specific robot number.

1. **Save and Close the Hosts File**: Save the changes and close the file by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to exit.

1. **Check Connectivity**: Check connectivity to the robot using its host name, `robotXX`:
    ```sh
    ping robotXX
    ```

1. **Create a Secure Shell Connection**: To access the robot remotely, create an SSH connection:
    ```sh
    ssh pi@robotXX
    ```
    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `ssh <username>@<hostname>`

1. **Enter the Robot's Password**: After entering the robot's password, the terminal should display the `pi` username and your robot's hostname, `robotXX`. 


### Setting Up Password-Free SSH Using RSA Keys

Using password-free SSH authentication improves both security and convenience. Instead of manually entering a password each time, SSH keys provide a more secure and automated way to log in. This also makes remote access faster and more efficient.

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair on the Client**: Open a terminal on the client machine and run the following command to generate an RSA key pair:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```
    When prompted to enter a file to save the key, press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).  If prompted for a passphrase, leave it **empty** (just press Enter) to enable password-free login.


1. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server**: You need to transfer your public key to the server. Run the following command, replacing `username` and `hostname` with your actual credentials:
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id username@hostname
    ```
    If prompted, enter your password for the remote machine. After this, the key will be added to the server's authorized keys.

1. **Test the Connection**: Now, try logging into the remote machine without a password:
    ```bash
    ssh username@server_ip
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should log in without being prompted for a password.




### Driving the Robot

1. Using the secure shell, Run the **turtlebot3_core.launch** file on the robot. 
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch
    ```

    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:** `roslaunch <package> <launchfile>`
    
    Your Turtlebot3 is now ready to drive and should be listening for *Twist* messages to be sent over the **/cmd_vel** topic.


    ```bash
    $ rosed turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch
    ```





1. It is always a good idea to check that the Turtlebot3 is communicating with the Master. To do this, we can list the active topics the Turtlebot3 sees. Run the following within your secure shell:

    ```bash
    $ rostopic list`
    ```
    
    If all is well, then there should be two topics provided by **roscore** running on the Master: **/rosout** and **/rosout_agg**. We will typically ignore these topics.
















    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:**  `rosed <package> <filename>`

    ```{note} 
    You may remember when we set up our *.bashrc* file we set the system variable **EDITOR** to `nano -w`. This enables the `rosed` command to utilize the nano editor.
   ```
   
    We will learn more about launch files in a few modules, but just understand that a launch file is used to launch one or more ROS nodes. This particular launch file only launches one node, **serial_node.py**. This node will connect to the OpenCR controller on the Turtlebot3 using the port and baud rate parameters. This connection will enable us to send *Twist* messages over the **/cmd_vel** topic to drive the Turtlebot3 using the keyboard.

1. Close the editor by hitting `ctrl+x`.



## Driving the robot
1. Open a new terminal on the Master and observe the nodes currently running:

    `rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph`
    
    You should only see one node running right now, **turtlebot3_core**, with no connections.
    
1. Open a new terminal tab and list the active topics. There should be one active topic other than the ones created by **roscore**: **/cmd_vel**.

1. We used the **/cmd_vel** topic when driving the simulated Turtlebot3, but let's refresh our memory about the topic:

    `rostopic info cmd_vel`
    
    As you can see the **/cmd_vel** topic is currently subscribed to by the **turtlebot3_core** with no publishers (just as we would expect after seeing the rqt_graph). We also note that topic utilizes the *Twist* message type. The following will show information about the fields within the *Twist* message sent over the **/cmd_vel** topic:
    
    `rostopic type cmd_vel | rosmsg show`

1. You can find information about pre-built packages by googling the package name along with the ROS distribution. Open up your favorite browser and google "teleop twist keyboard noetic". The first result should be from the ROS wiki page.

1. Ensure the ROS package **teleop_twist_keyboard** is installed on your Master:

    `rospack find teleop_twist_keyboard`
    
    If installed, the command should return the absolute path to the package, similar to `/opt/ros/noetic/share/teleop_twist_keyboard`
    
    If the command instead returns an error, then you need to install the package using apt:
    
    `sudo apt install ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard`
    
    ```{tip}
    All packages built for Noetic can be downloaded in the above manner (ros-noetic-desired-pkg with underscores in the package name replaced by dashes). Some packages were only built for previous ROS distribution and will have to be built from source (we will demonstrate this at a future time).
    ```
    
1. Run the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node on the Master:

    ```{tip}
    Don't forget your tab completion! You can start typing a package name or node and then hit tab for it to complete the command for you!
    ```
    
    `rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`
    
1. Before we get too excited and drive the Turtlebot3 off a cliff, observe how the nodes communicate using the **rqt_graph** tool in a new terminal (if you still have the previous rqt_graph running, you can hit the refresh button in the top left corner).

1. Select the terminal that has the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node running and observe the instructions for sending *Twist* messages. These are the same as when driving the simulated Turtlebot3.

1. The Turtlebot3 operates best with a linear velocity between 0.2 m/s and 0.5 m/s. It turns best with an angular velocity between 0.5 rad/s and 1.5 rad/s. Drive the Turtlebot3 using these parameters.

## ROS

In labs throughout this course we will request information about the topics, nodes, and messages within your system. Accomplish the following in a new terminal on your Master (you can ignore all nodes/topics that result from **roscore**).

1. List all running nodes.

1. Determine what topics the nodes subscribe and publish to (repeat for each node).

1. Display running nodes and communication between them.

1. List the active topics.

1. Determine the type of messages sent over the topics (repeat for each topic).

1. Determine the fields of the messages.

1. Observe the information sent over a topic (repeat for each topic).

## Checkpoint
Once complete, push screenshots showing the output of each of the above to your student repo on github in a /master/module04 folder.

## Summary
In this exercise you examined and used pre-built packages and source code to drive the Turtlebot3 and understand how the system worked. You then were able to analyze the topics, nodes, and messages within the ROS system to better understand the flow of information and control. The **pro-tips** presented throughout this exercise will make you a better user of Linux and ROS.







```{tip} 
I strongly recommend that you commit the above sequence of commands to memory, or at a minimum
have them in a place that you can quickly recall them. There is nothing until Module 9 that absolutely requires the real robot, as everything else can be simulated.
```
