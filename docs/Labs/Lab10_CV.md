## üìú Overview

In this lab, we explore how the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), enable object detection. By now, we‚Äôre all familiar with histograms, but in this context, they help simplify an image so a computer can quickly and accurately identify objects within it.

Rather than analyzing the gradient direction of every single pixel, HOG groups pixels into small cells. Within each cell, the gradient directions are computed and categorized into orientation bins, with stronger gradients carrying more weight. This approach helps reduce the influence of random noise and provides a structured representation of the image. HOG features maintain the distinct shape of an object while allowing for slight variations. For instance, consider an object detector designed to recognize a car:

```{image} ./figures/Lab10_HOG_Features.jpg  
:width: 600  
:align: center  
```  
<br>

Comparing each individual pixel of this training image with another test image would not only be time consuming, but it would also be highly subject to noise.  As previously mentioned, the HOG feature will consider a block of pixels.  The size of this block is variable and will naturally impact both accuracy and speed of execution for the algorithm.  Once the block size is determined, the gradient for each pixel within the block is computed.  Once the gradients are computed for a block, the entire cell can then be represented by this histogram.  Not only does this reduce the amount of data to compare with a test image, but it also reduces the impacts of noise in the image and measurements.  

```{image} ./figures/Lab10_HOG_Histogram.jpg
:width: 500  
:align: center  
```  
<br>

Now that we understand HOG features, let‚Äôs leverage OpenCV and Dlib to build a stop sign detector. First, we need to download a repository containing pre-made test and training data. Keep in mind that we won‚Äôt evaluate the algorithm‚Äôs effectiveness using the training data‚Äîit‚Äôs expected to perform well there. Instead, our goal is to use a diverse test set to develop a detector robust enough to recognize stop signs in new images.

## üß™ Lab Instructions: Object Detection Using HOG and ROS

In this lab, you‚Äôll build a stop sign detector using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features, test it, and integrate it with a ROS-based camera system.

(CV:HOG)=
### **1. Build a Detector Using HOG Features**

1. Open a terminal and download the demo repository:

    ```bash
    cd ~/master_ws/src
    git clone git@github.com:ECE495/HOG_Demo.git
    cd HOG_Demo
    ```

1. Inside the repo, you'll find folders for training and test images. We'll use a tool called `imglab` to annotate the training images.

1. Go to [imglab](https://solothought.com/imglab/#) in your browser.

1. When prompted, click **"UMM, MAYBE NEXT TIME!"** to skip the sign-in.

1. In the bottom left corner, click `load`, select the `training` folder from your local files, and then click `upload`. This should load 19 images.

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab10_Load.png
    :width: 150  
    :align: center  
    ```  

1. Select the **Rectangle** tool and begin labeling stop signs:

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab10_Rectangle.png
    :width: 50  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>

   - Click and drag to draw a bounding box **only around each stop sign**.
   - If an image contains multiple stop signs, draw a box around each.
   - If you make a mistake, select the box and press `delete`.

    ```{note} 
    It is important to label all examples of objects in an image; otherwise, Dlib will implicitly assume that regions not labeled are regions that should not be detected (i.e., hard-negative mining applied during extraction time).
    ```

    ```{tip}
    Use `Alt + ‚Üê/‚Üí` to switch between images.
    ```

1. Once you've labeled all images, press `Ctrl + e` to export your annotations.
   - Save the file as `stop_annotations.xml` in the `training` folder.

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab10_Dlib.png
    :width: 200  
    :align: center  
    ```  
1. Create a Python script:

    ```bash
    cd ~/master_ws/src/HOG_Demo
    touch trainDetector.py
    ```

1. Open it in your preferred code editor and paste in the following code:

    ```python
    # Import required libraries
    import argparse  # For parsing command-line arguments
    import dlib      # For training and testing the object detector

    # Set up command-line arguments
    ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    ap.add_argument("-x", "--xml", required=True, help="Path to input XML file")          # Path to the labeled training dataset in XML format
    ap.add_argument("-d", "--detector", required=True, help="Path to output detector (.svm)")  # Path where the trained .svm model will be saved
    args = vars(ap.parse_args())  # Parse the arguments into a dictionary

    # Inform the user that training is starting
    print("[INFO] Training detector...")

    # Set training options for the object detector
    options = dlib.simple_object_detector_training_options()
    options.C = 1.0               # Regularization parameter; higher values = lower bias, higher variance
    options.num_threads = 4      # Number of CPU threads to use for training
    options.be_verbose = True    # Print progress and training status to the console

    # Train the detector using the specified XML file and save the model
    dlib.train_simple_object_detector(args["xml"], args["detector"], options)

    # After training, test the detector on the training dataset to evaluate performance
    print("[INFO] Training accuracy: {}".format(
        dlib.test_simple_object_detector(args["xml"], args["detector"])))

    # Load the trained detector from disk
    detector = dlib.simple_object_detector(args["detector"])

    # Create a window to visualize the learned detector's HOG features
    win = dlib.image_window()
    win.set_image(detector)  # Show the detector as a HOG filter visualization

    # Wait for the user to hit Enter before closing
    dlib.hit_enter_to_continue()

    ```

1. Run the script to train your detector:

    ```bash
    python3 trainDetector.py --xml training/stop_annotations.xml --detector training/stop_detector.svm
    ```

    You may get a few errors pop up during execution based on your choice for bounding boxes.  Make sure you address those errors before continuing. If everything runs correctly, you‚Äôll see a visualization of the trained HOG filter as shown below. If you get an error, double-check your annotations and fix any issues.

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab10_HOG_Visualization.png
    :width: 250  
    :align: center  
    ```

(CV:Detector)=
### **2. Test the Detector**

Now it is time to build our code to test the detector.  

1. Create a new Python script:

    ```bash
    cd ~/master_ws/src/HOG_Demo
    touch testDetector.py
    ```

1. Add the following code:

    ```python
    # Import the necessary packages
    from imutils import paths   # Utility to easily grab file paths from a directory
    import argparse             # Used to handle command-line arguments
    import dlib                 # Library for machine learning tools including object detection
    import cv2                  # OpenCV for image processing

    # Set up command-line arguments
    ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    ap.add_argument("-d", "--detector", required=True, help="Path to trained detector (.svm)")
    ap.add_argument("-t", "--testing", required=True, help="Path to testing images folder")
    args = vars(ap.parse_args())  # Parse the arguments into a dictionary

    # Load the trained detector using the path provided
    # The .svm file contains the learned HOG + SVM model
    detector = dlib.simple_object_detector(args["detector"])

    # Loop through each image file in the testing directory
    for imagePath in paths.list_images(args["testing"]):

        # Read the image from disk using OpenCV
        image = cv2.imread(imagePath)

        # Convert the image from BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB (required by dlib)
        # Then, pass it to the detector which returns a list of bounding boxes
        boxes = detector(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))

        # Loop through each bounding box returned by the detector
        for b in boxes:
            # Get the coordinates of the bounding box
            (x, y, w, h) = (b.left(), b.top(), b.right(), b.bottom())

            # Draw the bounding box on the image using a green rectangle
            # (x, y) is the top-left, (w, h) is the bottom-right corner
            cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (w, h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

        # Display the image with the detections in a pop-up window
        cv2.imshow("Detection", image)

        # Wait for a key press before moving to the next image
        # (0 means wait indefinitely until a key is pressed)
        cv2.waitKey(0)
    ```

3. Run your test:

    ```bash
    python3 testDetector.py --detector training/stop_detector.svm --testing test
    ```

Look at your results. Did the detector work well? Were there any false positives or missed signs?

### **3. ROS: Live Camera Streaming**

ROS includes several tools for working with commercial off-the-shelf cameras, like the USB camera on your robot. The main one we'll use is the [usb_cam](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/p/usb_cam/) package, which is already installed. We'll now use ROS 2 and `usb_cam` to stream live video from the camera.

1. SSH into your robot and run:

    ```bash
    ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p video_device:=/dev/video0
    ```

    If you have an error that can't find the `usb_cam` package, install the package using
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-humble-usb-cam
    ```

    If you have a permission error, you need to run
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG video $USER
    sudo reboot now
    ```

Ignore any calibration error messages ‚Äî we‚Äôll handle that later.

1. On your Master PC, Run:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic list
    ```

    You should see topics like `/image_raw`, `/camera_info`, etc.

1. Check topic bandwidth:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic bw /image_raw
    ros2 topic bw /image_raw/compressed
    ```

1. Check image publishing rate:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic hz /image_raw
    ros2 topic bw /image_raw/compressed
    ```

1. View the camera feed:

    ```bash
    ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
    ```

    Select `/image_raw` to see the feed. Try waving your hand in front of the camera to check latency.

1. You may have noticed that streaming images over WiFi is quite slow. While using compressed images can help, it also increases the processing load on both the Raspberry Pi and the master computer. To avoid this during development, we'll run camera-related code directly on the master computer. Once everything is working, we can move the code back to the robot.

1. Disconnect the camera from the robot and plug it into the master computer. You can also unplug the gamepad‚Äîit's not needed for now.

1. On the master computer, run the following command to start the camera node:

    ```bash
    ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p video_device:=/dev/video0
    ```
1. Check topic bandwidth and image publishing rate:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic bw /image_raw
    ros2 topic hz /image_raw
    ```

1. To verify the image stream, launch the image viewer:

    ```bash
    ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
    ```

### **4. Capture Training Images with ROS**

You‚Äôll now use a script to save training images of stop signs from your live feed.

1. Download the [`image_capture.py`](../files/image_capture.py) script and place it in your package‚Äôs script folder.

1. Update your `setup.py` to include the script as an entry point. This is necessary to ensure that the script runs as a node.

1. Open the `image_capture.py` script and read through the code carefully. It may be unfamiliar, but take your time to understand what each part is doing.

1. Rebuild your package:

    ```bash
    ccbuild --packages-selelct labl0-cv
    ```

4. Run the USB camera node on Master:

    ```bash
    ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args -p video_device:=/dev/video0
    ```

5. Open a new terminal, navigate to the `Documents` directory, and run

    ```bash
    ros2 run lab10_cv image_capture -o ./training_images/
    ```

    Press `s` and `Enter` to save an image. Take multiple images from different angles and distances. Press `Ctrl + C` when done.

6. Use `imglab` again to annotate your new images and save the XML file as before. Then re-train your detector using the updated dataset.

---

### **5. Use the Detector in a ROS Node**

In this step, you‚Äôll create a ROS 2 node that runs your stop sign detector in real-time using the live camera feed.

1. Download the [`stop_detector.py`](../files/stop_detector.py) script and place it in your package‚Äôs script folder.

1. Update your `setup.py` to include the script as an entry point.

1. Edit `stop_detector.py`.
    - Inside the `camera_callback()` function, use the same image processing approach used in the `image_capture.py` script to convert ROS image messages into OpenCV format (`cv_image`).
    - Apply your HOG-based detector to the `cv_image`, just like you did in [Test the Detector](CV:Detector).
    - Draw bounding boxes around any detected stop signs.
    - Use `cv2.imshow()` to display the video, and make sure to call `cv2.waitKey(1)` to allow the video to refresh in real-time.

1. Use the following command, replacing `<path/to/detector>` with the path to your trained `.svm` detector file:

    ```bash
    ros2 run lab10_cv stop_detector -d <path/to/detector>
    ```

    You should now see a window displaying the camera feed with stop signs outlined.

1. Install `OBS Studio` to record your stop sign detection in action.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install obs-studio qtwayland5
    ```

1. Run `obs` from the terminal, or find it under `Applications`.

1. Set up recording:
   - In the *Scenes* panel (bottom-left), click the **`+`** and name your scene (e.g., "Stop Sign Detection").
   - In the *Sources* panel, click the **`+`** and choose **Window Capture**.
   - Select the window showing your detector output.
   - Click **Start Recording**.

1. Move around while keeping the stop sign visible to showcase detection capabilities. Present the stop sign from different angles, including varied pan, tilt, and rotation positions, as demonstrated in the video below.

1. When finished, click **Stop Recording**.

1. Upload your recording to the class Teams channel.

### **6. Estimating Distance to a Stop Sign**

In this section, you‚Äôll determine the distance between the stop sign and the camera using its known size and a detector.

1. **Calculate the Camera's Focal Length**: Start with a stop sign that has a known width, $Y$, positioned at a known distance, $Z$, from the camera. The detector identifies the stop sign and provides its perceived width in pixels, $y$. Using these values, calculate the camera‚Äôs focal length, $f$, with the following formula:  

    $$f = Z \times \frac{y}{Y}$$  

    To determine the focal length, print the perceived width of the stop sign, $y$.  

    ```{image} ./figures/Lab10_CameraModel.png
    :width: 300  
    :align: center  
    ```  
    <br>
1. **Estimate the Distance to the Stop Sign**: Once you have the calculated focal length, $f$, use it along with the known width of the stop sign, $Y$, and its perceived width in pixels, $y$, to compute the distance from the camera using this formula:  

    $$Z = f \times \frac{Y}{y}$$  

1. **Implement a Class for Distance Calculation**  
    - Define two class variables:  
        - `FOCAL`: The calculated focal length.  
        - `STOP_WIDTH`: The known width of the stop sign.  
    - Create a class function named `get_distance`, which calculates the distance using the `FOCAL` length and `STOP_WIDTH`.  

    ```{tip}
    Pay attention to the `x` and `w` variables in the `box`‚Äîunderstanding their role is crucial!  
    ```

1. **Publish the Distance**  
    - Set up a publisher to send the calculated distance using **Float32** messages from the *std_msgs* package on the */stop_dist* topic.  
    - Ensure the published distance reflects every detected object in the image.
