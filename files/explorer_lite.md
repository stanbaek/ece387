Got it! To autonomously explore an **unknown environment** and create a map using **Cartographer SLAM**, you need to set up an **exploration algorithm** that will drive the robot while Cartographer simultaneously builds the map.

### ðŸš€ **Approach: Use Cartographer + Explore Lite**
We can use the `cartographer` package for SLAM and the `explore_lite` package to autonomously explore unknown areas.

---

## âœ… **Step-by-Step Instructions**
### **1. Install the `explore_lite` Package**
If you don't have `explore_lite` installed, install it using `rosdep`:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/explore_lite.git
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select explore_lite
source install/setup.bash
```

---

### **2. Launch Cartographer for SLAM**
Start the Gazebo environment and Cartographer SLAM:

1. Start the Gazebo environment:
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

2. Start Cartographer:
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```

---

### **3. Start `explore_lite` to Explore the Environment**
Once Cartographer is running, start `explore_lite` to make the robot explore and map the unknown environment:

```bash
ros2 launch explore_lite explore.launch.py
```

---

### **4. Save the Map Once the Exploration is Complete**
Once the robot finishes exploring or you want to stop:

1. Save the generated map:
```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
```

2. Your map will be saved as:
```
~/map.pgm
~/map.yaml
```

---

## âœ… **Explanation**
- **Cartographer** handles the SLAM process (creating the map).  
- **Explore Lite** sends exploration goals to the navigation stack.  
- The robot will move toward unknown areas automatically, using Cartographer to update the map in real-time.  

---

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**
- If the robot gets stuck, restart `explore_lite`.
- If the robot stops moving, check if Cartographer is publishing `map â†’ odom` transforms.
- If you encounter mapping artifacts, try adjusting Cartographerâ€™s parameters.

---

## ðŸŒŸ **Next Steps**
1. Test the exploration in different environments.  
2. Adjust Cartographer's tuning parameters for better mapping.  
3. Once mapping is done, switch to Nav2 for autonomous navigation using the saved map!
